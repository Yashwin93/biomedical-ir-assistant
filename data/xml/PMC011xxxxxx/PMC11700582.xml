We aimed to determine the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for VF in The Gambia, West Africa. The Gambian Bone and Muscle Ageing Study is a prospective observational study in men and women aged 40&#x000a0;yr and over. Rural participants had baseline measurements and plasma samples collected and were followed up 6-8&#x000a0;yr later; urban participants had a single measurement. DXA scans were obtained to assess areal BMD (aBMD), body composition, and VF. Prevalence and incidence were calculated. Risk factors for prevalent and incident fractures were tested using logistic regression, in men and women separately, with and without adjustment for age and BMI. At baseline, 581 individuals (298 women) had useable scans, 214 (127 women) at follow-up. Prevalence of VF was 14.8%. Those with VF were older (65.6(11.2) vs 61.7(12.3) yr, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.01) and had lower aBMD <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic>-scores. For example, in women, a 1 SD increase in femoral neck <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic>-score resulted in a lower risk of having a prevalent VF (OR [95% CI]) 0.51 [0.38, 0.73]. In men, lumbar spine <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic>-scores were predictive of prevalent fracture (0.71 [0.53, 0.97]). The incidence of VF over follow-up was 12.1%. Low BMD and grip strength were associated with the odds of having an incident VF. Given the importance of prevalent VF in predicting future VF and other fragility fractures in other populations, our findings are a major cause for concern. VF prevalence in Gambian older adults is similar to elsewhere, despite fractures not being a perceived issue. Risk factors were like those identified elsewhere, including age, aBMD, and bone resorption. Understanding the impact of these fractures is important in a region where the health of the aging population needs to be prioritized.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>analysis/quantitation of bone</kwd><kwd>DXA</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd><kwd>general population studies</kwd><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source>

In such populations, access to care for osteoporosis is limited, with many competing priorities for healthcare.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> There are few clinicians and common treatments for prevention of fracture are not included on the essential medicines list.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In addition, access to imaging for vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) is limited and can be expensive, with radiographs being the most affordable technology. As with elsewhere on the globe, prevalence estimates vary, and methods of assessment and imaging often differ, as do the age ranges of inclusion.</p><p>VF are a major public health burden and are the commonest fragility fracture causing significant pain and mortality.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> VFs can be clinically challenging to detect and estimates range between 65% and 75% being undetected.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> This is due to the fractures often occurring asymptomatically and symptoms not manifesting until multiple fractures are present. In the UK, the 12-month survival rate in women aged 65&#x000a0;years and above was 86.5% compared to 93.6% expected, and a 5-yr survival rate of 56.5% compared to 69.9% expected.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Importantly, VF are preventable and are risk factors for future VF and other major osteoporotic fractures. A limiting factor in determining the epidemiology of VF prevalence has been that there are several methods of assessment with lack of agreement on the best methodology to assess the presence or absence of fractures. In addition, incidental reporting on standard radiology is not common practice. Together, these make the comparison across populations difficult. In 2017, Ballane <italic toggle="yes">et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> reported global prevalence data in men and women, with estimates ranging from 7% to 25%. Of note at the time, there was a lack of data from the Indian subcontinent, Middle East, or Africa, or globally across ethnic groups, indicative of disparities in healthcare and access to preventative treatment.</p><p>In South Africa, Conradie <italic toggle="yes">et&#x000a0;al.</italic> reported VF prevalence in Black and White African women aged 40&#x000a0;yr and above, assessing lumbar spine and thoracic radiographs. Most fractures were classified as mild (60%), with a higher prevalence in Black (9.1%) vs White (5.0%) women.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> More recently, in older Black African and Indian South African adults from KwaZuluNatal, prevalence was reported to be higher than in the Conradie study at 20.8%, with no apparent difference between African and Indian participants.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> In Black women from the Republic of Congo, Central Africa, prevalence from CT scans was reported to be 11.2%.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Currently, no data are available for incidence in Black African men and women and few data to describe risk factors for fracture with none in West Africa.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to determine VF prevalence and risk factors for VF in men and women aged 40&#x000a0;yr and over in rural and urban regions of The Gambia, West Africa. Secondary aims were to calculate fracture incidence and associated risk factors for incident fractures in rural participants (who had been followed longitudinally).</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>The Gambian Bone and Muscle Ageing Study (GamBAS-rural) is a prospective observational study in Black African men and women aged &#x02265;40&#x000a0;yr (ISRCTN17900679).

A group of urban participants, aged 60-80&#x000a0;yr, were recruited in 2019 using the same inclusion criteria as GamBAS and had one assessment.

Women had more prevalent fractures than men, although the differences were not as large as those reported elsewhere (16% vs 13%); in women aged over 60-yr, 1 in 5 had at least one prevalent fracture. VF prevalence in The Gambia, one of the lowest income countries in the world (in 2022 gross domestic product per capita was 840 USD<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>), is therefore similar to higher-income countries.</p><p>Areal BMD and age were the strongest factors associated with VF. A 1 SD lower <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic>-score was associated with a 40%-50% greater chance of having at least one prevalent VF; in men, the relationship was not as strong with approximately 30% greater risk of prevalent fracture. Only a small proportion of individuals with VF (24.4%; 36.7% women, 8.1% men), would be diagnosed with osteoporosis using femoral neck <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>-score thresholds. In those under 60 years of age, only 2.6% women would be osteoporotic, and 1.0% men. In those aged over 60 years, the proportions are greater, 30.3% women, 9.6% men. More than half this population would be diagnosed with osteopenia (60.7% women; 56.9% men). Caution is therefore needed in attributing the VF prevalence reported in this study to osteoporosis. Men with VF were younger than women with VF. The younger age of men may indicate trauma-related fractures rather than fragility fractures <italic toggle="yes">per se</italic>, though this cannot be determined in the current study. In general, these findings show the use of a &#x02212;2.5 SD <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>-score threshold, determined using NHANES III, cut-offs to distinguish fracture vs non-fracture cases is inappropriate. Furthermore, while the use of NHANES III is currently the only recommended and recognized way to diagnose osteoporosis and osteopenia in diverse populations, there is clearly a need to generate country-specific references for the creation of appropriate reference data curves.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> A further example of the limitation of using international references for diagnosis of osteoporosis was in a study of post-menopausal women in Zimbabwe, where racial and ethnic differences in body composition and body size were shown to impact diagnosis of osteoporosis.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p><p>Cross-country comparison of VF prevalence is difficult given differences in imaging technology and population sampling. In South Africa, prevalence in Black and Indian African men and women, median age 72.0&#x000a0;yr, was 20.8% in women, 13.0% in men.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Women were twice as likely to have a prevalent VF as men. These more recent data from South Africa are more than twice the prevalence previously described in Black and White South African women aged 40&#x000a0;yr and over, where they were reported to be 9.0% and 5.1%, respectively. The data potentially indicate increasing VF prevalence, though the differences in the age range and methodologies of the respective study populations should be noted.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> In the Republic of the Congo in Central Africa, prevalence was reported to be 11.2% in women aged 40&#x000a0;yr and above, though it should be noted that these assessments were using reformatted CT scans and the women were mostly in high socioeconomic classes of the country.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The recent South African study is the only other African study to present aBMD in individuals with and without VFs. Lumbar spine aBMD was lower in those with fractures, consistent with our findings in GamBAS though in contrast to GamBAS there were no differences in femoral neck or total hip aBMD. No other risk factors differed, though the sample size was limited, which may have impacted results.</p><p>Understanding the underlying causes and potential risk factors for VFs is important to address the need for prevention of future fragility fractures. In our study, age was higher and aBMD lower, and consequently <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic>-scores were lower, in those with fractures than those without. Women with VFs had lower 25(OH)D (63.2&#x000a0;nmol/L) compared to those without (69.5&#x000a0;nmol/L) with a trend toward lower 25(OH)D in women being risk factors for fracture. Despite 25(OH)D being adequate, compared to international standards, there is a possibility that in a population with ubiquitous UVB sunshine, the contribution of low dietary calcium intakes leads to skeletal sequalae at higher 25(OH)D concentrations and/or differing thresholds for sufficiency.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Although habitual calcium intake was very low relative to international standards,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> calcium intake was not associated with increased risk for fracture. In addition, there was no evidence that BMI, FMI, and LMI were factors associated with prevalent VF. One potential explanation for the lack of association with BMI, lean, or fat mass is that the study population was relatively homogenous, with few people with high BMI. While incident VF numbers were low, bone turnover was also associated with increased risk of incident VF. P1NP associations were robust to adjustment for age, whereas CTX were not. There was a trend toward baseline grip strength being predictive of incident VF, albeit attenuated by adjustment for age, potentially reflecting the frailty status of the participants with fractures.</p><p>The implications of these findings are several fold. In a cohort of older Gambia adults, the prevalence of VFs was similar to that reported elsewhere in the world.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Second, findings demonstrate the importance of not assuming risk factors translate across contexts. As the number of older individuals living in low- and middle-income countries increases exponentially, strategies to identify, prevent, and treat such fractures become even more important.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> In these resource-poor settings, access to anti-resorptive therapies, expertise in bone health, fracture liaison services, and hormone replacement therapy is limited. Therefore, understanding better the risk factors for fracture and seeking implementable ways of identifying VF and predicting the risk of future VF, with context-specific primary and secondary prevention strategies is paramount. More broadly, facilitating community knowledge and care is also an extremely important aspect of addressing the challenge posed by rising numbers of the aging population.</p><sec id="sec15"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The rural component of this work is one of the most detailed, prospective musculoskeletal phenotyping in aging adults in Africa to date. This is strengthened by study design, which ensured, through use of the Kiang West Demographic Surveillance Survey,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> random stratified sampling in 5-yr age bands and by gender, ensured rural participants were distributed appropriately across the region. All scans were read and analyzed by a single expert reader. Cross-calibrations for aBMD and body composition measured on the different instruments were performed, making all rural and urban measurements directly comparable.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The addition of urban subjects, prominently of the same ethnic group as the rural sample (Mandinka), allowed comparison of prevalence between urbanized and rural sites in The Gambia.</p><p>There are some limitations to this study. Findings may not be generalizable to the whole population; the focus here was on two regions (Sukuta is one of the most densely populated urban conurbations of the Gambia). GamBAS was powered to detect change in total hip aBMD, not to ascertain VF prevalence or incidence, or the associated risk factors. The number of incident fractures was low, making the generalizability of findings uncertain; more adequately powered studies are required. Second, DXA equipment was upgraded mid-study. Urban recruitment was at a different time to rural recruitment. Methods to recruit differed due to a lack of Demographic Surveillance System in Urban Gambia meaning convenience sampling was not used. Older adults were weighted toward older ages (60-80&#x000a0;yr), making the mean age slightly older than in the rural region. In addition. Some risk factor data were not available for the urban sample, limiting power to detect associations and to predict incident fracture. Self-reported fracture data were incomplete, meaning the association between pervious fracture and prevalent VF could not be tested. We did not adjust for multiple comparisons and cannot rule out findings that may have been due to chance, though the analyses performed were based on a priori hypotheses formed by known associations between age, BMD, body composition, and bone turnover on bone. Setting more conservative thresholds for significance may have increased the likelihood of missing true associations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, contrary to common perception, VF prevalence in Gambian women and men is similar to that seen in higher-income countries across the world. Given the rising aging population in low- and middle-income countries, and the consequent rises in non-communicable diseases, such as osteoporosis, this is concerning. There are currently no treatment options for VFs apart from pain relief. Finding scalable and achievable ways to inform communities and healthcare professionals of fractures and their consequences is of utmost important to prevent further challenges to already stretched healthcare resources and, most importantly, to individuals themselves.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary_Figure_S1_zjae182</label><media xlink:href="supplementary_figure_s1_zjae182.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sup2" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary_figure_2_zjae182</label><media xlink:href="supplementary_figure_2_zjae182.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sup3" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary_information_05-11-24_zjae182</label><media xlink:href="supplementary_information_05-11-24_zjae182.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="zjae182-ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>For Open Access, the author has applied a CC BY public copyright license to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission.
