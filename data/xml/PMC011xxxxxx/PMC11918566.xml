</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This case series involves two patients who presented with complaints of shoulder asymmetry and decreased range of motion in the affected shoulder since birth. The patients were 5 and 8&#x000a0;years old at the time of presentation, respectively. Clinical assessment and CT images confirmed SD in both patients. Operative correction of the deformity was planned using the modified Woodward approach and performed in both patients. Both patients have no intraoperative or postoperative complications and have reduced scapular misalignment and greater range of motion of the shoulder at 3-year and 1-year follow-up visits, respectively. This study suggests that the modified Woodward approach may be regarded as a successful operation for SD and operative correction at a young age may lead to better outcomes.</p><p>In 1863, Eulenberg was recognized as having written the first account of congenital elevation of the scapula. Since Sprengel documented four examples of the illness in 1891, the condition has been linked to his name<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. The deformity was later described in several brief case studies and retrospective assessments that clarified any potential-related problems.</p><p>Normally, the scapula moves in a scapulothoracic plane during abduction. As abduction progresses, the glenoid face moves medially, then tilts upward, and finally moves up as the arm moves to maximum elevation. From 0 to 30 degrees, the scapula rotates about its lower midportion; from 60 degrees onward, the center of rotation shifts toward the glenoid; and as the scapula rotates about that area, the inferior tip of the scapula is significantly laterally displaced<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Commonly in SD, the scapula is rotated, leading to medial displacement of the inferior tip. For this reason, the glenoid cavity faces downward, and the upwardly rotated superomedial angle appears characteristically prominent in the suprascapular region on inspection<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Cavendish classification is used to assess the severity of deformity in SD, and it has four grades:<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Grade 1: Very mild disease with level shoulder joint(s) and deformity rarely visible while the patient is dressed;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Grade 2: Mild disease with level shoulder joint(s) and visible lump-like deformity at the web of the neck while the patient is dressed;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Grade 3: Moderate disease with elevated shoulder joint(s) (2&#x02013;5 cm) and easily visible deformity;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Grade 4: Severe disease with elevation of the shoulder joint placing the superior angle of the scapula adjacent to the occiput.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Many authors refer to the Cavendish classification for surgical indication of SD, where surgery is best indicated for patients in grade 2 and grade 3<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. Both of our patients fall under grade 3 of this classification, i.e., the shoulder joint is elevated by 2&#x02013;5 cm compared to the opposite shoulder.</p><p>While there are no well-established indicators for surgical intervention, ROM and cosmetic appearance in relation to the Cavendish classification are commonly used to determine the necessity of surgery<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. Surgery is indicated only in extreme situations in Cavendish grade 3 or 4<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. A number of surgical procedures have been created with the intention of enhancing shoulder functionality and appearance<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. In general, these treatments entail translating the scapula inferiorly to a more caudad position and removing the projecting section of the scapula, along with any omovertebral bones<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. The Woodward and Green procedures are the most commonly performed surgical techniques<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. Intraoperative neuromonitoring while undergoing the modified Woodward procedure for SD has been shown to be a feasible and precise means for the detection of intraoperative neurologic changes and may help in preventing brachial plexus injury<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>; however, we were not able to perform the surgery with concurrent neuromonitoring as this resource was not available at our institution.</p><p>The Woodward procedure involves the resection of fibroid band and/or omovertebral bone along with downward migration of rhomboids and trapezius muscles<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. The modification of the Woodward procedure was proposed by Borges and Colleagues in 1996 after 31&#x000a0;years of the original Woodward procedure. It involves the release of muscles from their origin, relocation, and suturing distally with resection of the superomedial border of scapula. Adding morselization to the middle segment of the clavicle aims to prevent brachial plexus palsy and enhance correction<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. Consequently, we performed subperiosteal resection of the middle segment of the clavicle before the actual scapular correction.</p><p>Due to the association of widened surgical scarring associated with Green&#x02019;s procedure, the modified Woodward procedure remains as the reference standard<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, we opted to proceed with the modified Woodward procedure in our patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Favorable outcomes observed in both cases over the follow-up periods of 24&#x000a0;months in the first case and 12&#x000a0;months in the second case indicate the effectiveness of the modified Woodward approach in SD. However, the limited number of cases in this case series diminishes the generalizability of our findings. A larger dataset and comparative analysis would lead to a better understanding of this condition and its management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here, we have delineated two cases of a rare but most common cause of congenital scapular anomaly, SD. We emphasized favorable outcomes with low complications using the modified Woodward procedure in the management of SD. Thus, the modified Woodward procedure is a viable alternative with an excellent surgical outcome for the treatment of SD.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="equal"><p>Published online 9 January 2025</p></fn></fn-group><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Not required in our institution.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent for publication</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient&#x02019;s parents for publication and any accompanying images.
