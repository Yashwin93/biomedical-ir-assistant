An estimated number of CRC new cases surpassed 1.9 million, and CRC deaths surpassed 930&#x000a0;000 in 2020. An increase of 63% in the number of new cases/year and a jump to 73% in the number of deaths/year are predicted for the CRC burden by 2040<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Significant geographical disparities in CRC incidence and mortality were detected, with Europe, Australia, and New Zealand at the top regarding the incidence rates and Eastern Europe regarding the mortality rates. It is worth mentioning that effective screening strategies in developed countries have contributed greatly to the falling CRC incidence, as early diagnosis, receiving proper treatment, and regular check-ups have enhanced CRC survival rates and life quality. Countries with low-risk populations, comprising Africa, Eastern Mediterranean Region, Latin America, and Asia, are predicted to witness the highest changes<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Moreover, age is a significant factor for CRC, as older people aged 50 and above are the most affected individuals by CRC<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. However, CRC incidence has recently witnessed a staggering rise since the mid-1990s in younger individuals, which has driven more attention to earlier screening<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Additionally, CRC development is thought to be hugely affected by environmental factors, such as lifestyle factors, including smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption, and intake of processed meats, fruits, and vegetables. Thus, leading healthy lifestyles, avoiding risk factors, and screening for early detection substantially reduce CRC incidence and negative outcomes<sup>[1]</sup>. Other factors, including CRC family history, familial adenomatous polyposis, Lynch syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and chronic inflammation, are suggested to contribute to the development of CRC<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular pathogenesis of CRC</title><p>As a multifaceted disease, CRC arises owing to a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. CRC pathogenesis mainly involves a minimum of three routes, which are chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability, and CpG island methylator phenotype pathways<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, as mentioned in Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.
<fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Pathways of CRC pathogenesis<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ms9-87-192-g001" position="float"/></fig>
</p><p>With a series of molecular changes, the typical pathogenesis of CRC involves the progression of the normal epithelium of the colon into invasive cancer. The Vogelstein and Fearon model originally proposed these progression sequences, which contributed enormously to understanding CRC molecular progression. It begins with the initiation of hyperproliferation of normal colonic epithelium, then the formation of different types of adenomas (early, intermediate, and late), followed by the formation of carcinoma and metastasis causing death. The authors suggested this pathogenesis sequence is stimulated by a series of mutations in a number of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, such as the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, in the initial step of transforming normal epithelium into early adenoma, followed by the accumulation of other gene mutations, such as <italic toggle="yes">KRAS, TP53</italic>, and loss of heterozygosity 18q, in the subsequent carcinogenic steps. The authors also highlighted the importance of the accumulation of these alterations rather than their order in CRC tumorigenesis<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Multiple revisions were performed later to the original model, such as recognizing the potential of serrated polyps to transform into malignant tumors, not only tubular and tubulovillous adenomas as proposed earlier. While tubular adenomas are more commonly thought to be stimulated by genomic instability through suppressing the APC gene in addition to chromosome instability, premalignant serrated polyps are correlated with epigenetic alterations through the CpG island methylator phenotype, which represents aberrant hypermethylation of CpG dinucleotides underlining the heterogeneity of CRC and the involved genetic and epigenetic instability levels<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Importance of early detection in improving prognosis</title><p>Early detection of CRC by screening after 50&#x000a0;years of age is highly recommended, where disease prognosis is strongly associated with the subsequent timing of diagnosis and detected stage of disease. Less than 10% of individuals affected by CRC survive the later stages of disease progression (i.e., stage 4) compared to an estimated 90% of those who survive stage 1, according to a 5-year overall survival rate<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. As CRC possesses an extensive period of incubation exceeding 10&#x000a0;years and a lack of clear symptomatology, most cases are diagnosed post-stage 3 (i.e., local lymphatic infiltration) or 4 (i.e., distant metastases). The overall 5-year survival rate drops to less than 10% in these situations. Moreover, only an approximate 25% of individuals with liver metastases &#x02013; the most prevalent type of CRC metastasis &#x02013; may benefit from appropriate surgical intervention. Hence, prompt identification is essential for increased patient survival and improved clinical outcomes, expanding subsequent therapeutic options available<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Current treatment effectiveness and diagnostic challenges</title><p>While radiation and chemotherapy are thought to be the mainstay of oncological management for patients with CRC, these interventions also greatly lower an individual&#x02019;s quality of life, often associated with infection, dermatological sequelae, and/or nerve damage<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Now, stool-based testing and developments pertaining to radiological imaging are considered primary investigations for the screening of CRC in at-risk populations. Furthermore, owing to the advancements in &#x0201c;omics&#x0201d; as a means of analytical methodologies, an increasing number of molecular biomarkers have been recently observed to be of diagnostic benefit for CRC<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this review is to gain a better understanding of the existing research pertaining to the diagnosis of CRC, in particular, early detection modalities. Molecular biomarkers provide a personalized approach to disease confirmation, aid prognostic evaluation, and provide insight into the probability of patient-centered treatment response. While improvements in radiological imaging techniques provide comprehensive, high-quality images, this review aims to elucidate whether said innovations contribute to reduced complications and augmented diagnostic accuracy.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular biomarkers in CRC</title><p>A plethora of prospective potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis have emerged alongside the breakthroughs in molecular pathology, genomics, and proteomics<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. CRC biomarkers are usually acquired from liquid biopsies (genetic and epigenetic biomarkers) or tissue biopsies [including CTCs, cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA)/circulating tumor DNA, tumor-derived extracellular vesicles, autoantibodies, and tumor-educated platelets]<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic biomarkers</title><sec><title>APC</title><p>About 85% of CRC cases are associated with the APC gene, and since APC is closely linked to the signaling system of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin, targeting Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling can be effective for CRC patients with APC mutations<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. According to previous studies, the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway was blocked by retinoic acid-induced 2<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>, and controlled by a few other naturally occurring substances such as acetophenone and antibiotics<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. Some other treatments and approaches were used for treating patients with APC mutations. Nevertheless, they were unable to completely halt APC-induced CRC in addition to the serious adverse effects of conventional medicine. Thus, there is a need to find new target genes for APC-driven CRCs<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Kirsten rat sarcoma virus</title><p>The mutation of the Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) gene in cases of CRC is typically located at the 35th nucleotide of the 12th codon from Guanine to Thymine and is deemed to be closely associated with cancer invasion and lymphatic infiltration<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. The KRAS gene plays a vital role in cell proliferation and differentiation processes, and it is necessary for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and RAS cellular signaling pathways. The KRAS gene is fundamental for the diagnosis and management of CRC since the mutation is observed in approximately 85% of cases<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. According to recent research, patients can receive <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>-expanded T cells to enable their immunity to recognize RAS-mutated specific antigens<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>P53 gene</title><p>In colon cancer, the tumor protein gene (P53 gene) is mutated at a rate of 22&#x02013;70%<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, the p53 gene is assumed to be associated with CRC distant metastasis and vascular invasion owing to the higher frequency of mutated p53 genes in distal colon tumors than in proximal ones<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>. According to recent research, a leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein can be used as a therapeutic target for chemotherapy resistance induced by p53 mutations. Furthermore, in both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> studies, the combination of 5-fluorouracil with gossypol-acetic acid, a particular inhibitor of leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein, increased the drug&#x02019;s efficacy<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the molecular pathways, mainly the mentioned genetic biomarkers, in CRC progression<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>.

</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Epigenetic biomarkers</title><sec><title>Methylated DNA biomarkers</title><p>DNA methylation is one of many epigenetic modifications that have been exploited in the early detection and diagnosis of many diseases, including cancers<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>, whereby it is assumed to display a significant impact on CRC pathogenesis and disease progression<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup>. Overall, cancer cells typically exhibit genome-wide hypomethylation alongside localized, specialized alterations (i.e., mostly hypermethylation) at regulatory regions such as promoters, often resulting in aberrant gene expression, functioning as cancer molecular biomarkers<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>A set of DNA methylation markers with a high level of accuracy and repeatability in a range of noninvasive and semi-invasive samples has been published throughout the prior decade. Researchers are currently working on creating a broad molecular biomarker panel to facilitate the diagnosis of CRC, possessing high sensitivity for differential diagnoses comprising CRC. Furthermore, it is thought that harnessing epigenetic modifications for oncotherapy in precision medicine will enhance curative abilities<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Specific markers</title><p>Although current research on employing DNA methylation for earlier detection of CRC remains fairly novel<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, some studies have identified some potential methylated DNA biomarkers for prompt CRC diagnosis, including septin 9 gene (SEPT9), N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 4 (NDRG4), and bone morphogenetic protein 3 (BMP3). In addition, genetic methylation of wif-1, inositol monophosphatase 2 protein, and secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) exhibited high levels of specificity and sensitivity for CRC<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, it is reported that Syndecan-2 (SDC2) may play a vital role in the early diagnosis of CRC as its methylation expression was detected in higher levels in the earlier stages of CRC than in healthy tissue<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>SEPT9 is a guanosine triphosphate-binding protein and a member of the septin gene family whose role in the development of CRC is still under investigation. However, many reports have detected SEPT9 hypermethylation in CRC patients<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup>. Interestingly, in CRC diagnosis, methylated SEPT9 (mSEPT9) exhibited higher sensitivity than other traditional markers such as fecal occult blood test, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>-<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup>, and the diagnostic sensitivity rose when m<italic toggle="yes">SEPT9</italic> was combined with any one of them, particularly in the early stages<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup>. Although most studies reported relatively low mSTEP9 sensitivity between 8 and 40% for adenomas and polyps<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup>, a recent research paper showed higher positive detection rates in adenomas and villous adenomas with significant dysplasia. The difference is thought to be attributed to the algorithm used in these studies<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, mSEPT9 in plasma/serum was reported in several studies to have a sensitivity range of 47&#x02013;87% and a specificity range of 89&#x02013;98%<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup>. This sensitivity remained low in early stages (I and II), and rose with higher stages, reaching 100% in stage IV<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>BMP3 is a member of a transforming growth factor-beta superfamily of cytokines, and it inhibits growth by affecting the suppressor of mothers against decapentaplegic family member 4 (SMAD4) gene transcription regulation. It was found that BMP3 downregulation might contribute to CRC early tumorigenesis<sup>[<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup>. NDRG4 is also involved in cell growth as well as differentiation. Like BMP3, NDRG4 was found to be downregulated in CRC<sup>[<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup>. Although using <italic toggle="yes">5 mC</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">5hmC</italic> as molecular markers is vital for the diagnosis of different cancer types, it has been hindered in the case of CRC by tiny sizes of samples and limited performance of the quantifying and analyzing methods used in addition to the loss of 5hmC in the advanced metastatic stages<sup>[<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]</sup>. Nonetheless, it is noticed that the sensitivity of early-stage CRC can be improved by using 5hmC in multianalyte testing<sup>[<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Syndecan-2 (SDC2) is a member of the Syndecan family. It is also called fibroglycan and encodes a transmembrane type I heparan sulfate proteoglycan<sup>[<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</sup>. Frequent hypermethylation in the SDC2 promoter region has been found in the stool and blood samples of CRC patients<sup>[<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]</sup>. DNA containing methylated <italic toggle="yes">SDC2</italic> extracted from stool holds great promise for the detection of noninvasive CRC with high specificity and sensitivity<sup>[<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The SFRP2 gene methylation in serum samples was found to be associated with a poor grade of differentiation, high tumor-node-metastasis stage coupled with +ve lymph node metastasis and deep cancer invasion in the wall tissue. Moreover, cases with positive SFRP2 hypermethylation in blood, stool samples, and tumor tissue exhibited lower overall survival compared to negative SFRP2 methylation cases<sup>[<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Interestingly, the combination of <italic toggle="yes">SFRP2, BMP3, NDRG4</italic>, and vimentin gene (<italic toggle="yes">VIM</italic>) methylation testing relatively increased the sensitivity and specificity for CRC. However, when it comes to the format of point of care, using biological samples for DNA methylation testing becomes challenging<sup>[<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Micro ribonucleic acids</title><sec><title>Role of micro ribonucleic acids in CRC pathogenesis</title><p>Numerous studies have established a link between micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) and the development of CRC since microRNA (miRNA) expression is often lower in tumors than in healthy tissue<sup>[<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]</sup>. There is growing evidence that miRNA plays an important role in CRC pathophysiology<sup>[<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]</sup>, where miRNA controls the growth and dissemination of CRC via angiogenesis, cellular signaling pathways, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)<sup>[<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]</sup>. Several miRNA-mediated cellular signaling pathways, including the inactivation of APC and the overactivation of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathways, thought to be the main contributors to CRC onset, are involved in the development and spread of CRC<sup>[<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Diagnostic and prognostic potential of specific miRNAs</title><p>Abundant research has been conducted to examine miRNA expression patterns at either early or advanced stages of CRC<sup>[<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]</sup>. For instance, elevated levels of miR-21, miR-29a, and miR-125b expression were associated with early CRC stages, high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasms, and tubular adenomas. In addition, they could be employed to differentiate advanced from non-advanced stages of CRC<sup>[<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, some miRNAs were used to predict treatment response, which may facilitate the process of monitoring and predicting treatment efficacy, such as miR-126, whose elevated levels were predictive of poor response to bevacizumab (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody), and decreased levels post-therapy were predictive of enhanced overall survival rates<sup>[<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]</sup>.

Therefore, a plethora of methodologies have been developed to detect serum CTCs<sup>[<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]</sup>, generally categorized into two main classifications: label-dependent and label-independent isolation techniques. While label-independent methods isolate CTCs without relying on present cell surface markers, they do so by successfully separating them from blood cells based on distinct biophysical features like size and deformability. Label-dependent methods use antibodies that target cell surface antigens in CTCs, which are distinguished by the presence of epithelial markers unlike normal blood cells<sup>[<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is the most widely employed marker for CTCs in a variety of cancers as the source of most CTCs is epithelial cells<sup>[<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]</sup>.

Examples comprise the use of patient-specific genetic material in CRC<sup>[<xref rid="R116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]</sup>. Molecular heterogeneity in CRC, including that of the microsatellite instability and hypermutation phenotype, is also significant in differences among patient treatment responses. High-throughput NGS technologies have contributed to a better understanding of tumor biological behavior and thus increased the precision of its prognostic and chemotherapeutic drug response analysis<sup>[<xref rid="R117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]</sup>. In addition, by detecting circulating tumor DNA, which indicates patients at higher risk of recurrence and those more likely to experience chemotherapeutic resistance, such recognition may aid in determining the most appropriate treatment course<sup>[<xref rid="R117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Several additional important areas of emphasis pertaining to future developments in CRC diagnosis have been identified. Advancements in the development of novel targeted therapy and immunotherapeutic research are based on pre-existing literature regarding CRC as a heterogeneous disease with distinct tumor-specific characteristics affecting prognosis and clinical outcomes. Resultingly, these insights have shaped the scope of clinical trials for future treatments<sup>[<xref rid="R116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]</sup>. Hence, the search for more advanced diagnostic techniques that would allow earlier detection of CRC is ongoing. Furthermore, prognostic indicators that are superior to those in use now could be found. Tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and cancer cell properties are prognostic variables. These new indicators may help infer the most appropriate course of management, allowing further ease when assessing patient prognosis implicated in CRC<sup>[<xref rid="R117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Research concerning CTCs may significantly aid CRC diagnosis and management. Future studies focusing on the identification and characterization of CTCs to improve prognosis and develop individualized treatment plans are warranted. Successful targeted therapies additionally require specialized analysis of the genetic and phenotypic profiles of CTCs, which are often different from those of the primary tumor<sup>[<xref rid="R118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]</sup>. We urgently necessitate novel emerging molecular biomarkers that aid the prognosis and diagnosis of CRCs. Further, studies examining the utilization of nanotechnology seem very promising in CRC diagnostics and therapeutics, where the development of new paradigms in nanotechnology for prompt CRC diagnosis and treatment remains of profound scientific interest. Studies aimed at improving the sensitivity and specificity of nanotechnology-based therapeutic applications might potentially improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates<sup>[<xref rid="R119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]</sup>. For these two important domains, molecular biomarker research must proceed and continue to thrive, encompassing molecular biomarkers generated from tumor tissue alongside those based on liquid biopsies. Proposed primary objectives for future study direction may be to validate and apply these molecular biomarkers in clinical settings for early identification, follow-up, and precision treatment of CRC<sup>[<xref rid="R120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]</sup>. Nonetheless, there are various important issues that must be resolved to ensure the successful implementation of these novel technologies in the health systems of low- to middle-income countries. Laboratories and training facilities for genetic testing and analysis are basic needs that require serious infrastructure development. Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of genetic technologies is also imperative so as to ensure access and context relevance in local settings. There needs to be education and training for healthcare providers, supportive regulatory frameworks, and public awareness campaigns promoting acceptance of the concept of genetic testing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A combination of its poor prognosis, morbidity, and mortality rates, CRC is renowned as one of the most fatal neoplasms globally. These issues are mostly caused by a failure to detect CRC in a timely manner. Prompt diagnosis is therefore an essential measure for reducing the mortality rate associated with CRC. However, because early indicators of CRC are not always evident and diagnosis is often influenced by other intestinal pathologies like that of colitis, CRC diagnostics remain challenging in modern medicine. We have reviewed and described several developments in the diagnosis and detection of CRC in this review, including the application of molecular biomarkers, such as protein, genetic, and epigenetic markers for detection, alongside highlighting the latest developments in radiological imaging modalities. To aid in early detection, this review also integrates imaging techniques with molecular biomarkers.</p><p>It is now possible to investigate potential clinical implications as diagnostic or therapeutic targets in CRC in greater detail thanks to an improved understanding of the regulatory processes governing cancer-specific epigenetic modifications. There is still a need for improvement in the diagnostic performance of said molecular biomarkers when it comes to prognosis, response to treatment prediction, or detection of early CRC stages. As these may lessen the reliance on conventional biopsy-based techniques, modern imaging technologies provide the foundation of most therapeutics established to support the detection and follow-up of all phases of treatment in all forms of cancers, including solid tumors. The ability of labeling methodologies to distinguish between cancerous and healthy cells is fundamental to the efficacy of imaging technologies. With the development of more sophisticated diagnostic biomarkers and imaging techniques utilizing these proteomic/genomic biomarkers, next-generation therapeutics will be available, providing far more effective detection and treatment alongside a reduced likelihood of disease relapse in the near future for most cancers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank the members of the Oli Health Magazine Organization for their contribution and support for this manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Sponsorships or competing interests that may be relevant to content are disclosed at the end of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>All co-authors approved the first manuscript.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>All co-authors have read and approved the submission.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>Published online 9 January 2025</p></fn></fn-group><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Ethics approval was not required for this review.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>Informed consent was not required for this review.</p></sec><sec><title>Sources of funding</title><p>We have not received any financial support for this manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contribution</title><p>O.U. contributed to conceptualization, project administration, writing &#x02013; review and design, as well as reviewing and editing the first and final drafts.
