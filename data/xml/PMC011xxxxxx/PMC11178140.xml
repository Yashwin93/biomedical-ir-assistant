The productivity of these locations is not only affected by tangible elements but also by intangible factors, such as the emotions generated by the experiences. For this purpose, 597 employees of hotels in these historical locations who had visited one of the 14 heritage sites in Spain assessed what role emotions play in this contribution. The methodology used was the application of structural equations. Several conclusions have been drawn utilizing the SmartPLS 4 software. The first is that the generation of positive emotions comes exclusively from cultural and historical dynamization and not from technological advances or an eagerness to learn. The second is that both the application of technological advances and cultural dynamization have a direct impact on productivity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>productivity</kwd><kwd>heritage sites</kwd><kwd>tourism</kwd><kwd>emotions</kwd><kwd>architecture</kwd><kwd>economy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

These factors depend on urban development models. Some urban models evaluate the level of productivity in terms of the economic density that such areas maintain (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Ahlfeldt and Pietrostefani, 2017</xref>).

Urban World Heritage Sites (WHS) have immense cultural, historical, architectural and economic importance and effectively contribute to local economies (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Bowitz and Ibenholt, 2009</xref>). Economic productivity has been widely studied in the simplest dimension and measured through the number of visitors, tourism income, job creation and contribution to the local economy (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Loulanski, 2006a</xref>,<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Petronela, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Parte and Alberca, 2023</xref>). Sociocultural productivity, in the context of urban WHS, goes beyond mere economic production (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Caust and Vecco, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The cultural and social productivity of an urban WHS is related to its ability to foster a sense of identity, pride and social cohesion among local communities (<xref rid="ref90" ref-type="bibr">Tan and Tan, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref101" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Folgado-Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al., 2024</xref>). To measure this dimension, some studies have included the participation of local residents in cultural activities, educational programmes and community events related to the heritage site. In those studies, are measured elements like (1) community engagement and participation, the active involvement of local residents in cultural activities, educational programs, and community events related to the heritage site is essential for fostering socio-cultural productivity, (2) heritage interpretation and education through programs to enhance socio-cultural productivity by promoting understanding, appreciation, and stewardship of cultural heritage among local communities, (3) cultural diversity and inclusivity, it thrives in environments that embrace cultural diversity and inclusivity, where different perspectives, traditions, and identities are celebrated and respected, (4) social cohesion and collaboration among local stakeholders. They are fundamental for sustaining socio-cultural productivity within an urban WHS, (5) economic sustainability and livelihoods to support socio-cultural productivity by providing opportunities for local residents to derive economic benefits from heritage-related activities and businesses (<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Parga-Dans et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>This socio-cultural participation can be extended from residents to the parties that interact in the WHS, such as the local tourism administration, companies on the supply side and tourists (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Moli, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Al-Hammadi, 2022</xref>). This interaction makes it possible to develop sociocultural tourism products that can be measured (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">McCamley, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Cheng and Chen, 2022</xref>). Sociocultural products also contribute to developing an identity, culture and heritage based on the historical and cultural revitalisation of said ancient spaces (<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Nocca, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Al-Hammadi, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>2.2</label><title>The value of emotions (E)</title><p>The study of the emotions generated by the experiences of employees working in heritage places offers very relevant information for the analysis of the productivity of these spaces (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abd Aziz et al., 2020</xref>). Hotel employees are first-hand witnesses to the day-to-day experiences at heritage sites and can provide more qualified information than tourists themselves by knowing how the attractiveness of these places&#x02019; impacts on life within these historic spaces (<xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">Robina-Ram&#x000ed;rez et al., 2023a</xref>,<xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Although emotions play an important role in the tourism experience, rigorous empirical research on this topic is limited (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abd Aziz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Hosany et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">Robina-Ram&#x000ed;rez et al., 2023a</xref>). As <xref rid="ref92" ref-type="bibr">Timothy (2011)</xref> noted, we know relatively little about the psychological and emotional underpinnings that drive WHS visitation.</p><p>According to cognitive appraisal theory, emotions are mental states that result from the processing or evaluation of personally relevant information (<xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr">Roseman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr">Robina-Ram&#x000ed;rez et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, goal congruence as evaluation determines the emotional response (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Hosany et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, several studies argue that a location&#x02019;s WHS status is an important aspect of its attractiveness (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen and Cheung, 2014</xref>), but increased visitation as a result of being listed as a WHS can have negative impacts on the site&#x02019;s sustainability (<xref rid="ref91" ref-type="bibr">Tarawneh and Wray, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref100" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Cultural, historical and natural treasures are not mere physical landmarks, but repositories of stories and traditions that have shaped human civilisation by connecting visitors to their origins (<xref rid="ref93" ref-type="bibr">Tung and Ritchie, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abd Aziz et al., 2020</xref>). When visitors explore venerable temples or ancient ruins, they may feel a sense of awe and reverence for the people who built these places (<xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr">Salemink et al., 2020</xref>), beauty and joy (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Nisbet and Zelenski, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Urban heritage contributes significantly to the cultural identity of a city (<xref rid="ref100" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).

Locals may experience a deep sense of attachment, as their personal histories become intertwined with the city&#x02019;s history generating empathy and connection related to the achievements of past generations (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2023</xref>). This intertwining can give rise to a sense of nostalgia from the collective memories embedded in the architecture, streets and landmarks (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Prayag and Del Chiappa, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Fostering positive emotional connections can create a virtuous circle that benefits both visitors and workers at the sites themselves (<xref rid="ref94" ref-type="bibr">Van Dijk and Kirk, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref96" ref-type="bibr">Veetikazhi et al., 2023</xref>). When tourists connect emotionally with a site, they become advocates for its protection (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2021</xref>).

According to <xref rid="ref97" ref-type="bibr">Williams (2006)</xref>, the emotions generated by positive experiences lead visitors to repeat their visit and to suggest the destination to others which positively affect the sociocultural productivity.

This intangible heritage enables the development of cultural, historical (<xref rid="ref88" ref-type="bibr">Su, 2020</xref>), educational and learning activities.</p><p>Second, more than half of the improvements in the sociocultural productivity of heritage sites are explained by the emotions of visitors to heritage places. Fostering positive emotional connections not only contributes to improved visitor expectations for these environments, but also creates a virtuous circle that benefits both visitors and site workers (<xref rid="ref94" ref-type="bibr">Van Dijk and Kirk, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Third, technology currently plays an essential role in cultural-historical dynamization. Advances in technology also allow for the pursuit of greater community participation, which also facilitates the promotion of dialogue between visitors (<xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">Simon, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Mugobi and Mlozi, 2021</xref>) and their dissemination and access impacting positively to the sociocultural productivity at the historical sites (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Affleck and Kvan, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Fourth, emotions are generated from historical and cultural dynamisation. This evidence comes from the affirmation of H3 and rejection of H4 and H7. Historical-cultural dynamisation becomes the primary reason for the generation of emotions, as explained by the third hypothesis. Emotions are generated not only by the ability of heritage sites to connect with the past through their architectural wonders and narratives (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Lowenthal, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref102" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Arumugam et al., 2023</xref>), but also because they help to build the identity of visitors who come to these places to better understand their history (<xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">Rouhi, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Cheng and Chen, 2022</xref>) from the traditions and values passed on through the generations (<xref rid="ref95" ref-type="bibr">Vecco, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec19"><label>6.2</label><title>Practical implications</title><p>First of all, it is necessary to highlight the importance of the proposed model as a tool for improving the productivity of heritage sites based on the experience of hotel employees. The fact that they work in these historic sites makes them qualified agents in defining the main factors that affect the productivity of these sites. This information may be of great interest to the tourism authorities and businesses residing in such historic environments.</p><p>Second, with the growth in technological advances, cultural institutions are beginning to orient the promotion and productivity of heritage places towards participatory design approaches that encourage dialogue with their visitors, adopting practices that are more focused on cultural demand (<xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">Simon, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Mugobi and Mlozi, 2021</xref>). This also allows for the better management of both visitor experiences and the emotions generated from them (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Ciolfi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref99" ref-type="bibr">Yan and Wall, 2022</xref>) through better control over cultural content to decide what, where and how to share it with visitors (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Giaccardi, 2012</xref>). All this activity allows for the better collection, management or display of cultural heritage (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Giglitto, 2017</xref>), which has an impact on improving its productivity.</p><p>Third, the improvement of educational dynamics has a positive effect on productivity, as stated in the fifth hypothesis (SD -&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;P, &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.312; T&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.152; <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.000). This enhancement requires fostering a deeper understanding of these sites among local visitors (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Leslie, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">Rasoolimanesh et al., 2021</xref>) through educational training programmes designed by tourism authorities (<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abd Aziz et al., 2020</xref>). The aim of these cultural actions is to provide a better connection with the historical and cultural attractions of heritage sites (<xref rid="ref92" ref-type="bibr">Timothy, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">Rasoolimanesh et al., 2022</xref>), places that help to deepen the visitor&#x02019;s understanding of the reality of the past by fostering emotions such as a sense of belonging and pride.</p></sec><sec id="sec20"><label>6.3</label><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>This study has several limitations.
