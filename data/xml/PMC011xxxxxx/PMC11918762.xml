It is the sixth most prevalent cancer in developed nations<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The prevalence and incidence of ovarian cancer vary by region, with developed countries showing higher rates. According to recent statistics, approximately 313&#x000a0;959 cases are reported annually, and 207&#x000a0;252 succumbed to death, highlighting its severe mortality rate<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Ovarian cancer prevalence varies significantly worldwide, with the highest rates in Western Europe and North America, moderate levels in Southern and Eastern Europe as well as South America, and the lowest rates observed in the Middle East and Asia<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In the United States, approximately 19&#x000a0;680 new cases of ovarian cancer are expected, and 12&#x000a0;740 deaths from the disease are projected in 2024 by the American Cancer Society. Ovarian cancer constitutes 2.5% of all cancers affecting women, ranking as the eleventh most prevalent malignancy in this demographic<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it ranks as the second most prevalent cancer in the United States<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Additionally, it ranks as the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in the United States and is regarded as the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>One of the primary challenges associated with ovarian cancer is the frequent late-stage diagnosis. In most developed countries, the median age at diagnosis is approximately 63&#x000a0;years, and ovarian cancer is more prevalent in older women than in younger women<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Early-stage ovarian cancer typically manifests with vague symptoms such as urinary urgency, bloating, and pelvic pain, which are often mistaken for benign conditions. This misdiagnosis contributes to a poorer prognosis and lower survival rates<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Ovarian cancer is associated with certain risk factors that can complicate its early detection. Factors such as age, genetic predisposition, such as BRCA gene mutations, both 1 and 2, family history of ovarian or breast cancer, and reproductive history significantly influence the likelihood of developing the disease<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. It is a multifaceted disease that can arise at any age and can originate from different cell types within the ovary, such as oocytes, granulosa cells, theca interstitial cells, and the surface epithelium<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Classification of ovarian cancer</title><p>The most recent classification by the WHO recognizes five primary histological types of ovarian cancer: clear cell carcinoma, endometrioid carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC), and high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC)<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Among the various subtypes of ovarian cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer is the most prevalent, representing approximately 90% of cases. This subtype arises from the cells lining the outer surface of the ovaries. Other, less common subtypes include germ cell tumors, which develop from the egg-producing cells, and stromal tumors, which originate from the supportive tissue cells that maintain the ovary&#x02019;s structure and produce female hormones<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Significant advancements in understanding tumor behavior and identifying potential treatment options have been made, particularly in HGSC, through the molecular classification of ovarian cancer. HGSC is mainly categorized into four subtypes according to gene expression profiles and fundamental biological features. The immunoreactive subtype is characterized by high immune cell infiltration and immune-related gene expression, suggesting potential sensitivity to immunotherapy. The proliferative subtype exhibits high levels of cell proliferation markers, often associated with rapid tumor growth and worse overall survival (OS). In contrast, the differentiated subtype represents a more differentiated tumor profile with lower proliferation levels, generally correlating with better prognosis. The mesenchymal subtype shows features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, often linked to a more aggressive phenotype and varied therapeutic responses<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Beyond HGSC, other ovarian cancer types also possess distinct molecular features. For instance, LGSC is often driven by mutations in BRAF, KRAS, and ERBB2, presenting a less aggressive clinical course compared to HGSC<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Clear cell carcinoma frequently harbors mutations in ARID1A and PIK3CA, often displaying unique metabolic profiles and resistance to standard chemotherapy<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Endometrioid carcinoma may share mutations with endometrial cancer, such as PTEN and mismatch repair genes<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Our study examines mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (MIRV), an FDA-approved drug, evaluating its properties, dosage, mechanism of action, and potential advantages for treating ovarian cancer. It seeks to offer essential insights into this therapeutic option, assisting individuals in understanding the possible benefits of MIRV in addressing the rising rates of ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Pathogenesis of ovarian cancer</title><p>Several theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. These include the fallopian tube, incessant ovulation, and two-pathway theories.</p><sec><title>Incessant ovulation theory</title><p>According to incessant ovulation theory ovarian cancers arise from the ovarian surface epithelium, which undergoes repetitive trauma and DNA damage during ovulation. This damage leads to the formation of cortical inclusion cysts that can transform into cancer cells due to hormonal exposure. However, this theory fails to account for the pathogenesis of different histological types of ovarian cancer or the variations in prognosis. Additionally, it contradicts the increased risk of ovarian cancer observed in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, despite their fewer ovulation cycles<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Fallopian tube theory</title><p>This theory suggests that ovarian cancer frequently develops from early-stage lesions in the fallopian tubes, particularly in women carrying BRCA1/2 mutations. Studies have found epithelial dysplasia in the Fallopian tubes resembling HGSC, known as tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (TIC). TP53 gene mutations are present in TIC, similar to those in serous ovarian cancer. The fimbria region of the Fallopian tube, rich in blood vessels, is a common site for TIC and is believed to facilitate metastasis to the ovaries<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Two-pathway theory</title><p>The two-pathway theory was proposed in 2004, which categorizes ovarian cancer into type I and type II based on histological, genetic, and clinical characteristics (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Type I includes low-grade serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, and transitional histologies originating from the ovary, growing slowly, and being genetically stable, with common KRAS and BRAF mutations. Type II comprises undifferentiated, high-grade serous, and carcinosarcoma histologies, often originating from the fallopian tube, growing aggressively, and being genetically unstable, with frequent TP53 mutations and BRCA1/2 gene associations. This theory explains the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer more comprehensively than others but still lacks an understanding of non-ovarian origins<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.<fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The two-pathways theory of ovarian cancer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ms9-87-001-g001" position="float"/></fig>
</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Detection and diagnosis of ovarian cancer</title><p>The symptoms associated with ovarian cancer lack specificity, posing a challenge in early detection, as they can mimic those of other medical conditions. Typically, these symptoms manifest prominently in the late stages of the disease (stage III or stage IV)<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Currently, screening methods for ovarian cancer encompass transvaginal ultrasound (TVU), physical examination, and serum biomarkers estimation, chiefly CA125<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. However, the limited sensitivity of CA125 in detecting early-stage disease necessitates exploring alternative biomarkers such as cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and human epididymis protein 4, which demonstrate potential for identifying specific subtypes<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Advancements in imaging modalities, including Doppler ultrasound to enhance TVU accuracy, high-resolution imaging via MRI, and PET/CT scans amalgamating structural and functional data, offer improved diagnostic capabilities. Emerging hysteroscopy techniques employing Falloposcope devices aim to procure cytological samples from the fallopian tubes, presenting a promising avenue for early screening and diagnosis<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. Concurrently, the evolving landscape of biomarkers, encompassing miRNA, the cancer microbiome, autoantibodies, extracellular vesicles, and metabolomics, is reshaping ovarian cancer diagnostic strategies. Additionally, advancements in imaging technologies hold potential for augmenting precision and sensitivity in detecting minimal disease volumes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Current treatment overview for ovarian cancer</title><p>The management of ovarian cancer typically involves a two-pronged approach, which involves initial surgery followed by chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen is predominantly platinum-based and is administered intravenously, often in conjunction with taxane drugs. This treatment is delivered in six cycles, each spaced three weeks apart<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. However, in cases involving less aggressive tumors (G1/G2) or early-stage cancers (IA/IB), chemotherapy may be deemed unnecessary. As the disease progresses, achieving complete tumor removal becomes increasingly difficult, particularly when tumors invade critical areas such as the liver or small bowel mesentery<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. In such advanced cases, the first line of action often involves chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before considering surgical options. If a positive response is observed after three cycles, surgery may be feasible, followed by additional chemotherapy<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. Despite the potential for a complete response to initial treatment, the risk of recurrence remains a significant concern for many patients.</p><p>The interval between treatments, known as the treatment-free interval, along with the tumor&#x02019;s response to platinum-based drugs, plays a vital role in determining prognosis<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. The efficacy of platinum chemotherapy largely depends on the speed of tumor relapse, which serves as an indicator of its sensitivity to these agents. This sensitivity is crucial for guiding subsequent treatment decisions. For tumors that remain responsive to platinum, combining it with other agents such as gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) has been found beneficial for managing both highly and partially responsive malignancies<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. In cases where platinum is no longer effective, an alternative approach may involve combining PLD with trabectedin for partially sensitive recurrences. Unfortunately, patients who exhibit resistance or refractoriness to platinum treatments tend to have a poorer prognosis<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In cases where chemotherapy is combined with bevacizumab, there is evidence of significantly extended progression-free survival (PFS) for patients maintaining good performance status. Furthermore, in selected instances of recurrent ovarian cancer, surgical intervention may still offer an opportunity for radical treatment, complete remission, and potentially a year-long respite from the disease post-initial therapy<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><sec><title>Mechanisms of resistance</title><p>Platinum-based drugs achieve their anticancer activity by binding covalently to DNA, which interferes with its replication and promotes cell death by generating cross-links. However, resistance to these treatments can arise from various factors, including immune responses, epigenetic modifications, genetic alterations, and environmental influences<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. The effectiveness of platinum-based chemotherapy is closely tied to a cell&#x02019;s ability to recognize and repair drug-induced DNA damage, a process regulated by the DNA damage response mechanism<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. Dysregulation of this mechanism can lead to either increased susceptibility to the drugs or the development of resistance. In platinum-resistant cancers, overexpression of DNA repair proteins such as BRCA 1/2, MSH1, MSH2, ERCC proteins, RAD51, and Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 is often observed<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Moreover, alterations in drug transport channels can disrupt the influx and efflux of platinum salts within cancer cells, resulting in diminished concentrations of cisplatin and leading to unrepaired DNA lesions<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. While platinum-based chemotherapy continues to serve as a cornerstone of cancer treatment, its limitations underscore the necessity for more targeted interventions. By directly addressing the molecular pathways that drive cancer growth and survival, targeted therapies have the potential to minimize damage to healthy tissues, overcome drug resistance, and improve long-term patient outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx as drug therapy</title><p>Recently, MIRV has been approved for adult patients with Folate receptor (FR) &#x003b1;-positive, PROC, primary peritoneal and tubular cancer by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for people who have undergone one to three prior treatment courses<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. This antibody&#x02013;drug conjugate (ADC) includes a chimeric anti-FR&#x003b1; monoclonal antibody (IgG1 subtype), a chemically synthesized microtubule inhibitor DM4, and a chemically synthesized cleavable linker, sulfo-SPDB<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. MIRV specifically targets FR&#x003b1; on the surface of cells, leading to the uptake of the receptor&#x02013;ADC complex and its subsequent degradation within lysosomes<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. This mechanism releases the DM4 payload, which triggers cell cycle arrest and ultimately results in cell death (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In vivo research has demonstrated anti-tumor effectiveness in mouse xenograft models of FR&#x003b1;-positive ovarian cancer<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>.<fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The mechanism of action of MIRV.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ms9-87-001-g002" position="float"/></fig>
</p><p>MIRV&#x02019;s mechanism of action combines targeted delivery with cytotoxic effects, positioning it as a useful treatment option for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC). Its structure includes a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically attaches to FR&#x003b1;, a cleavable linker, and a powerful cytotoxic component called DM4, a type of maytansinoid<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. Targeting FR&#x003b1; is crucial because this receptor is often overexpressed in ovarian tumors, allowing for the precise delivery of the cytotoxic drug directly to cancer cells while reducing harm to normal tissues<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>. This targeted approach minimizes systemic toxicity, which is a common drawback of conventional chemotherapy<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. When MIRV attaches to FR&#x003b1; on tumor cell surfaces, it undergoes uptake through receptor-mediated endocytosis. After entering the cell, the cleavable linker becomes activated, releasing the DM4 payload. DM4 disrupts microtubule dynamics, leading to cell cycle arrest and ultimately triggering apoptosis in the cancer cell<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. This mechanism is particularly effective in tumors that express high levels of FR&#x003b1;, as it ensures that the cytotoxic effects are concentrated where they are most needed<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Besides its direct cytotoxic effects, MIRV has been demonstrated to activate immune responses. Its binding to FR&#x003b1; can trigger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis, boosting the immune system&#x02019;s capacity to identify and eliminate cancer cells<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. This dual mechanism of action &#x02013; direct cytotoxicity combined with immune activation &#x02013; provides a comprehensive approach to treating ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence from the clinical trials</title><p>The FDA evaluated the pharmacology of MIRV by analyzing detailed data from five studies: Study 0401 (NCT01609556), 0416 (NCT04209855), Study 0417 (NCT04296890), Study 0403 (NCT02631876), Study and Study 0402 (NCT02606305) (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>)<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. In 2017, Study 0401 showed promising results for MIRV in FR&#x003b1;-positive PROC. However, Study 0403 did not find a considerable benefit in FR&#x003b1;-positive tumors. As a result, MIRV was then tested only in the FR&#x003b1;-high population in Study 0417, using a different folate receptor test and achieved positive results<sup>[<xref rid="R22"

</p><sec><title>Drug efficacy</title><p>The approval of MIRV was largely contingent upon the findings from a multicenter, randomized trial that included 453 patients with PROC, primary peritoneal or tubular cancer. Participants could have received up to three previous instances of systemic therapy and were chosen based on the presence of FR&#x003b1;-positive tumors identified using the VENTANA FOLR1 (FOLR1-2.1) RxDx Assay<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>. Subjects were randomly distributed (1:1) to either receive MIRV at a dose of 6 mg/kg (determined using adjusted ideal body weight) via intravenous infusion every three weeks or undergo a chemotherapy regimen, chosen by the study investigator until disease progression occurred or unacceptable side effects arose<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>. In total, 227 patients were designated to the MIRV group, while 226 were allocated to the chemotherapy group<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>. Among these, 425 participants received a minimum of one dose of their assigned therapy, with 218 in the MIRV group and 207 in the chemotherapy group, all of whom were included in the safety evaluation cohort<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>A complete response (CR) was characterized by the total elimination of all target lesions, with any pathological lymph nodes showing a reduction in short-axis measurement to below 10 mm. Conversely, a partial response (PR) was defined as a minimum 30% decrease in the aggregate diameters of target lesions when compared to baseline measurements<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>.In the safety evaluation cohort, the median duration of treatment was 4.98&#x000a0;months for the MIRV group, while it was 2.96&#x000a0;months for the chemotherapy group. Among the specific chemotherapy regimens, the median durations were 2.3&#x000a0;months for topotecan, 2.76&#x000a0;months for PLD, and 3.80&#x000a0;months for paclitaxel<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoints included PFS, OS, and overall response rate (ORR). The treatment showed a median OS of 16.5&#x000a0;months, in contrast to 12.7&#x000a0;months for chemotherapy, with a significant difference (hazard ratio for death, 0.67; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> =&#x000a0;0.005). The median PFS was 5.6&#x000a0;months compared to 4.0&#x000a0;months (hazard ratio 0.65; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001), and the ORR was 42% versus 16% (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001)<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>. In the MIRV group, 12 participants (5.3%) experienced a CR, indicating that all target lesions completely disappeared. Meanwhile, a PR was observed in 84 participants (37.0%), reflecting at least a 30% reduction in the overall diameters of target lesions. In comparison, the chemotherapy group had no cases of complete response, with 36 participants (15.9%) showing partial responses.</p><p>Other secondary endpoints evaluated included the duration of response, response of cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), and safety profiles. The median duration of response for the 96 responders in the MIRV group was 6.77&#x000a0;months, while it was 4.47&#x000a0;months for the 36 responders in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio, 0.62). Additionally, a higher percentage of participants in the MIRV group showed a CA-125 response compared to those in the chemotherapy group (58.0% versus 30.3%)<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety evaluation</title><p>The clinical safety assessment involved 106 patients from Study 0417 (SORAYA Phase 3 Trial) who received a minimum of one dose of MIRV. Each patient was administered a single-agent dose of MIRV at 6 mg/kg (calibrated for ideal body weight) on the first day of every 3-week cycle (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>)<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>. The most commonly reported grade&#x000a0;&#x02265;3 adverse reactions (ARs) included visual impairment (7%) and keratopathy (9%). Permanent treatment discontinuation due to ARs was observed in 11% of patients, primarily linked to thrombocytopenia (2%) and intestinal obstruction (2%). Additionally, 20% of patients experienced dose reductions as a result of ARs, predominantly due to keratopathy (7%) and visual impairment (9%). Moreover, delays in dosage were required for 39% of patients, frequently related to keratopathy (11%) and visual impairment (15%)<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>.<fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Adverse events observed in the MIRV group compared to the chemotherapy group.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ms9-87-001-g003" position="float"/></fig>
</p><p>The suggested dosage of MIRV is 6 mg/kg (based on adjusted ideal body weight), delivered as an intravenous infusion once every three weeks (21-day cycle) until either disease progression or intolerable toxicity arises. Unacceptable toxicities may include severe ocular issues such as visual impairment, keratopathy, dry eye, uveitis, photophobia, and eye pain<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. Premedication with a corticosteroid, antihistamine, and antipyretic is recommended to mitigate potential adverse reactions. The prescribing guidelines feature a boxed warning about ocular toxicity, as well as additional cautions concerning pneumonitis, peripheral neuropathy, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Patients are instructed to use preventive ophthalmic topical steroids and lubricating eye drops to lower the likelihood of eye-related complications. An eye examination, which should include a visual acuity test and a slit lamp evaluation, is advised at baseline, every other cycle for the first eight cycles, and as clinically necessary<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup>. Adjustments to the dosage should be determined by eye examination results, with immediate changes implemented for any new or worsening toxicities to maintain patient safety and treatment effectiveness.</p><p>MIRV represents a significant advancement over current standard treatments for PROC, including chemotherapy regimens such as paclitaxel, PLD, and topotecan. These traditional therapies often yield limited response rates and can be accompanied by substantial systemic toxicity, including myelosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal side effects. Treatment regimens may require frequent dose adjustments or changes due to these adverse effects, leading to challenges in maintaining effective therapy over time. In contrast, MIRV targets FR&#x003b1;-positive tumors, providing a more precise mechanism of action that may enhance therapeutic outcomes while reducing overall toxicity.</p><p>The traditional treatment landscape often lacks the specificity needed to address the diverse molecular characteristics of ovarian tumors, resulting in a one-size-fits-all approach. Moreover, the management of side effects in standard chemotherapy frequently necessitates additional interventions, such as the use of growth factor support for neutropenia. While MIRV does have specific ocular toxicities requiring careful monitoring and management, its potential for tailored therapy based on biomarker status offers a shift toward personalized medicine. This targeted strategy not only improves efficacy but also aims to preserve healthy tissue, making MIRV a valuable alternative in the evolving landscape of ovarian cancer treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The majority of patients in the clinical trials have medium-to-high levels of folate receptor alpha (FR&#x003b1;) expression, which restricts the applicability of the findings to individuals with lower FR&#x003b1; levels. This limits the MIRV&#x02019;s usefulness to a larger group of patients with ovarian cancer. The outcomes of some trials may not be generalizable if individuals have specific co-morbidities or have had particular previous treatments. Patients included in the trial may fare differently from those who have already received other experimental medicines. Many studies that focus on PFS and ORR as outcomes have relatively short follow-up periods. Our comprehension of the long-term advantages and hazards of treatment is limited by the incomplete evaluation of longer-term outcomes like OS and sustained quality of life.</p><p>The majority of the research focuses on patients with PROC, excluding people with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer or patients with other ovarian cancer subtypes, such as mucinous or clear cell histologies, where MIRV may also be helpful but is still under investigation. A significant limitation is the short follow-up period of many studies, which may not adequately capture delayed adverse effects, including cumulative toxicities or treatment-related secondary malignancies. Another drawback is MIRV&#x02019;s ocular toxicity, with patients commonly experiencing dry eyes, blurred vision, and keratopathy. While most ocular adverse effects are reversible, they can still negatively impact a patient&#x02019;s quality of life, potentially requiring dose adjustments or discontinuation of treatment, reducing the drug&#x02019;s overall effectiveness. Ocular toxicity management relies on dosage modifications and supportive care measures (e.g., eye drops), but the research may lack comprehensive, standardized protocols for preventing and addressing these adverse effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The authorization of MIRV represents a significant advancement in treatment options for patients with FR&#x003b1;-positive primary ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer. This ADC employs a targeted therapeutic approach by concentrating on FR&#x003b1; found on cancer cells, thereby minimizing damage to healthy tissues and potentially overcoming drug resistance often encountered with standard chemotherapy. Clinical studies have underscored the encouraging effectiveness of this ADC, showing its ability to improve OS and PFS, as well as achieving a notable ORR.</p><p>However, the safety profile of MIRV necessitates vigilant monitoring, particularly concerning ocular toxicity, a significant adverse effect linked to the drug. With suitable dosage modifications and proactive management techniques, including premedication and routine ophthalmologic evaluations, the benefits of this therapy are expected to outweigh its risks. Looking forward, the outlook for MIRV in ovarian cancer treatment appears promising. Its approval offers a vital alternative for patients who have previously received systemic therapies, addressing a critical gap in cancer treatment. In summary, the emergence of targeted therapies such as MIRV signifies a meaningful progress in combating ovarian cancer, with the potential to enhance patient outcomes and improve quality of life globally.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Sponsorships or competing interests that may be relevant to content are disclosed at the end of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>Published online 9 January 2025</p></fn></fn-group><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>No patient was involved in this type of study; therefore, no ethical approval was required.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>The study is an editorial and was not done on patients or volunteers; therefore, no written consent was required.</p></sec><sec><title>Sources of funding</title><p>All the authors declare to have received no financial support or sponsorship for this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contribution</title><p>A.S.: conceptualization and project administration, visualization; A.S., L.S., A.K., H.I., original draft of manuscript; A.A., reviewing and editing the manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest disclosure</title><p>All the authors declare to have no conflicts of interest relevant to this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Research registration unique identifying number (UIN)</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec><title>Guarantor</title><p>Aymar Akilimali.</p></sec><sec><title>Provenance and peer review</title><p>Not commissioned, externally peer-reviewed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec><title>Presentation/assistance with the study</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>None.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ali</surname><given-names>AT</given-names></name>
