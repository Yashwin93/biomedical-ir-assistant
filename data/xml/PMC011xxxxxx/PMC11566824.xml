nanoparticles
(MPDA NPs) using an emulsion-induced interface assembly strategy and
loaded epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) into MPDA NPs via electrostatic
attraction to form EGCG@MPDA NPs. In the post myocardial infarction
(MI) environment, these interventions specifically aimed to eliminate
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and facilitate the repair of MI. We
further combined them with a thermosensitive chitosan (CS) hydrogel
to construct an injectable composite hydrogel (EGCG@MPDA/CS hydrogel).
Utilizing <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, the EGCG@MPDA/CS
hydrogel exhibited excellent ROS-scavenging ability of H9C2 cells
under the oxidative stress environment and also could inhibit their
apoptosis. The EGCG@MPDA/CS hydrogel significantly promoted left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) in infarcted rat models post injection for
28 days compared to the PBS group (51.25 &#x000b1; 1.73% vs 29.31 &#x000b1;
0.78%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In comparison to the PBS group,
histological analysis revealed a substantial increase in left ventricular
(LV) wall thickness in the EGCG@MPDA/CS hydrogel group (from 0.58
&#x000b1; 0.03 to 1.39 &#x000b1; 1.11 mm, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).
This work presents a novel approach to enhance MI repair by employing
the EGCG@MPDA/CS hydrogel. This hydrogel effectively reduces local
oxidative stress by ROS and stimulates the nuclear factor erythroid
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chitosan</kwd><kwd>injectable hydrogel</kwd><kwd>myocardial infarction</kwd><kwd>EGCG</kwd><kwd>PDA</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>92249301</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100012166</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFC3602400</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>am4c08155</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>am4c08155</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>At a global scale, cardiovascular
disease is the primary factor
responsible for both death and disability. Caused by blockage of coronary
arteries, myocardial infarction (MI) results in permanent damage and
death of myocardial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Revascularization,
including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), thrombolysis,
and coronary artery bypass grafting, is the main emphasis of modern
medical interventions for acute MI treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> However,
the infarcted myocardium cannot regenerate, ultimately leading to
end-stage heart failure. Various pathological changes occur following
acute MI, including oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, and the release
of inflammatory factors. These ultimately result in extensive loss
of myocardial cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> impaired cardiac function, and
ventricular remodeling. Intense generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) during MI surpasses the cellular antioxidant capacity, leading
to oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> The problem in eliminating ROS
after MI is the insufficient retention of pharmaceuticals at the site
of the infarction caused by the fast blood flow in the heart. This
leads to inefficient treatment with current anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant medications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup></p><p>Tissue
engineering and regenerative medicine present encouraging
approaches for heart repair following MI. Hydrogels are classes of
networked structures with a three-dimensional swelling structure which
possess excellent biocompatibility, an internal porous structure,
and tunable mechanical strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Injectable
hydrogels based on natural polysaccharides have shown significant
potential in MI repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Chitosan is a naturally
occurring cationic linear polysaccharide composed of repeating units
of <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine. Synthesized through
the deacetylation of chitin, it can be enzymatically degraded by lysozymes
within the human body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Demonstrating
exceptional biocompatibility and degradability, it finds extensive
application in the fabrication of natural hydrogels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup></p><p>Despite the proven efficacy of specific natural product
derivatives
and synthesized nanomaterials, such as melanin/alginate hydrogels,
iron-curcumin nanozymes, and molybdenum-based nanodots, in eliminating
ROS, they face limitations such as low elimination efficiency, restricted
biocompatibility, high cost, and inadequate biodegradability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Polydopamine (PDA) is a polymer synthesized by oxidative polymerization
of dopamine, exhibiting excellent cell affinity and tissue compatibility,
and is capable of scavenging ROS radicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> In order to augment its efficiency in scavenging ROS, we contemplated
the inclusion of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). EGCG, the predominant
polyphenolic component found in green tea, has inherent anti-inflammatory
and antioxidant characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> When
combined with PDA, it can enhance the ROS-scavenging capacity of PDA.
Moreover, PDA&#x02019;s sustained release of EGCG can increase its
retention time at the infarct site. However, typical PDA materials
have a relatively low drug-loading capacity. Mesoporous polydopamine
(MPDA) with a mesoporous structure offers a larger surface area and
higher drug-loading capacity, making it an attractive new option for
drug loading with PDA materials.</p><p>This study synthesized EGCG-loaded
mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles
(EGCG@MPDA NPs) encapsulated in chitosan hydrogel for post MI repair.
This newly fabricated hydrogel encapsulating EGCG@MPDA NPs has the
potential to be a new therapeutic choice for treating MI by eliminating
ROS and inflammation, which attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis under
oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Preparation and Characterization of MPDA NPs
and EGCG@MPDA NPs</title><p>The synthesis pathway of EGCG@MPDA NPs
is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>A. The synthesis of MPDA nanoparticles was achieved by employing
Pluronic F-127 and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) as organic molecules
of template within an aqueous solution. Subsequently, EGCG-loaded
EGCG@MPDA NPs were further synthesized. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) revealed that both MPDA NPs and EGCG@MPDA NPs exhibited spherical
structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>B,C). Compared to MPDA NPs, the surface cavities of EGCG@MPDA NPs
became blurred and decreased in quantity, indicating the successful
loading of EGCG into the mesoporous structure of MPDA. The distribution
of particle sizes of MPDA NPs and EGCG@MPDA NPs was studied through
the nanometer particle size potentiometer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>D,E). The average hydrodynamic size of MPDA
NPs was approximately 190.5 nm, which was consistent with previous
research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> and the average diameter of
EGCG@MPDA NPs was approximately 207.6 nm. MPDA NPs and EGCG@MPDA NPs
had exceptional dispersibility and uniformity, as indicated by their
polydispersity index (PDI) values below 0.2. Furthermore, the zeta
potential of MPDA NPs was determined to be &#x02212;23.77 &#x000b1; 1.23
mV, whereas the zeta potential of EGCG@MPDA NPs was seen to be &#x02212;28.34
&#x000b1; 1.01 mV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>F). The changes in zeta potential and particle size indirectly indicate
the successful loading of EGCG. Analysis of the materials&#x02019;
elemental composition and structure was conducted using Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), which also enabled the detection of
different intrinsic functional groups in molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> To examine the structural modifications of MPDA following
interaction with EGCG molecules, we performed an analysis of the FTIR
spectra of EGCG, MPDA NPs, and EGCG@MPDA NPs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>G). Compared to the spectrum of MPDA NPs,
only some peaks of EGCG@MPDA NPs showed changes in position and intensity,
attributed to specific functional groups. The differences in absorption
peaks seen at wavenumbers of 1350, 1604, and 1036 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> were attributed to the elongation of C=O bonds, the bending
of C&#x02013;C bonds, and the contraction of O&#x02013;H bonds, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Moreover, the newly observed absorption peak at 3355 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> may be ascribed to the elongation of O&#x02013;H bonds in hydroxyl
groups in EGCG. Overall, the spectra of EGCG@MPDA NPs exhibited minor
changes compared to those of MPDA NPs, with characteristic absorption
peaks of both EGCG and MPDA NPs present. These results suggested that
EGCG is physically coupled to the surface of MPDA NPs via hydrogen
bonds, and the incorporation of EGCG did not alter the structure of
MPDA NPs. Furthermore, the average drug-loading capacity of EGCG@MPDA
NPs was 37.83%, whereas nonporous PDA NPs had a drug-loading capacity
of only 7%&#x02013;10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Therefore, MPDA
NPs can load more drug because of their mesoporous structure.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Nanoparticle

Testing of Hydrogels</title><p>MPDA/CS and EGCG@MPDA/CS hydrogels with
varying concentrations were efficiently synthesized within 5 min after
the introduction of the &#x003b2;-glycerophosphate (&#x003b2;-GP) solution.
MPDA NPs and EGCG@MPDA NPs were evenly distributed, leading to homogeneous
hydrogel formulations. Chitosan gelation is enhanced by the inclusion
of &#x003b2;-GP through three mechanisms: increasing the pH to the physiological
range of 7.0&#x02013;7.4, inhibiting precipitation formation, and imparting
thermosensitive properties to the chitosan hydrogel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> As the concentrations of MPDA NPs and EGCG@MPDA NPs increased,
the apparent color of the hydrogels deepened gradually (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A). Through the addition of
various concentrations of EGCG@MPDA/CS hydrogels to the medium for
cultivating H9C2 cells, we examined the cytocompatibility of the hydrogels.
Experiments with the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) showed that EGCG@MPDA/CS
hydrogels exhibited an exceptional biocompatibility. H9C2 cell viability
decreased with the increasing concentration of EGCG@MPDA/CS (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.4c08155/suppl_file/am4c08155_si_001.pdf">Figure S1A</ext-link>). H9C2 cell viability was good when
added with the CS hydrogel, 2 mg/mL EGCG@MPDA/CS hydrogel, and 2 mg/mL
MPDA/CS hydrogel (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.4c08155/suppl_file/am4c08155_si_001.pdf">Figure S1B</ext-link>). On the seventh
day of culturing H9C2 cells, live/dead cell staining showed only a
small amount of cell death in the CS hydrogel, 2 mg/mL EGCG@MPDA/CS
hydrogel, and 2 mg/mL MPDA/CS hydrogel groups (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.4c08155/suppl_file/am4c08155_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>). The potential hemolytic properties of biomaterials

the hemolysis rates of the CS hydrogel group and the 2 mg/mL EGCG@MPDA/CS

that MPDA/CS and EGCG@MPDA/CS hydrogels have a porous structure, enabling

that the storage modulus (<italic>G</italic>&#x02032;) of all hydrogels
surpassed the loss modulus (<italic>G</italic>&#x02033;), providing
proof of the effective formation of solid hydrogels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>C). Furthermore, the inclusion
of both types of particles did not have any impact on the formation
of chitosan hydrogels. The changes in <italic>G</italic>&#x02032; and <italic>G</italic>&#x02033; with frequency for the hydrogels are shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.4c08155/suppl_file/am4c08155_si_001.pdf">Figure S4A</ext-link>. All the hydrogel materials exhibited <italic>G</italic>&#x02032; values that exceeded their respective <italic>G</italic>&#x02033; values. This finding indicates that the hydrogels
have the ability to continuously maintain their solid state over the
spectrum of frequencies that were investigated. Furthermore, the hydrogels
were subjected to FTIR analysis to investigate the influence of nanoparticle
incorporation on the chemical composition of the hydrogel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>D). Absorptivity
peaks at approximately 2870 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in the CS hydrogel
are associated with the stretching vibrations of C&#x02013;H bonds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> The peaks observed at 1556 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> are attributed to the deformation and elongation of the &#x02013;NH
functional groups. Spectral peaks at 1410 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> correspond
to the O&#x02013;H splitting vibrations. Moreover, the peak at around
1025 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> originates from the stretching vibration
of the C&#x02013;O&#x02013;C bonds in the polysaccharide structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Comparable peaks were detected in the MPDA/CS
and EGCG@MPDA/CS hydrogels, and the inclusion of MPDA NPs and EGCG@MPDA
NPs did not lead to the emergence of any new distinctive peaks. Overall,
the chemical structure of MPDA/CS and EGCG@MPDA/CS hydrogels remained
mostly unchanged, indicating that there was no chemical cross-linking
between MPDA NPs/EGCG@MPDA NPs and the CS hydrogel. Physical interactions
between the CS hydrogel and MPDA NPs/EGCG@MPDA NPs, including possible
hydrogen bonding, may account for the slight changes in the peak position
and intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Moreover, the mechanical
characteristics of the hydrogels were assessed, as depicted in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.4c08155/suppl_file/am4c08155_si_001.pdf">Figure S4B</ext-link>. Comparable compression moduli were
observed among the hydrogels, with the EGCG@MPDA/CS hydrogel having
a compression modulus of 11.32 &#x000b1; 1.525 kPa. The mending effectiveness
of hydrogels might, moreover, be influenced by their mechanical characteristics.
Rather, pliable hydrogels can enhance the transfer of mechanical impulses
and the synchronization of contractions in myocardial tissue, therefore
facilitating the restoration of heart function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> The process of adhesion is of utmost importance in cementing
the hydrogel to the adjacent cardiac tissue following the injection.
The adhesive properties of the hydrogels were analyzed, and the adhesion
