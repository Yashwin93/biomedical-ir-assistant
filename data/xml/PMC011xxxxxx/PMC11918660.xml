Preventing this problem expedites the patients&#x02019; return to normal activities following surgery and significantly increases their satisfaction. There are no condensed results that show the prevalence and contributing variables of postoperative nausea and vomiting in Africa. Thus, the purpose of this meta-analysis and comprehensive review was to ascertain the prevalence and contributing variables of postoperative nausea and vomiting in Africa.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Studies were retrieved from the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database, CINAHL, Scopus, Mednar, and Google Scholar databases using combinations of searching terms and Boolean operators. <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>-squared (<italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sup>2</sup>) statistics is used for evaluating study heterogeneity. Every publication is assessed for methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal criteria. Using a funnel plot, publication bias is visually assessed. Subgroup analyses investigate the source of heterogeneity. To determine whether publication bias exists, the Eggers weighted regression test is employed. STATA software version 14 was used to perform statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In Africa, the combined incidences of nausea 24.96 % (95% CI: 17.903-32.018), vomiting 23.655 % (95% CI: 17.542-29.769) and nausea with vomiting 15.27 % (95% CI: 9.118-21.424) . History of motion sickness (odds ratio [OR]: 3.19 (95% CI 1.08&#x02013;9.42), <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.036) and history of postoperative nausea and vomiting (OR: 4.33 (95% CI 2.654&#x02013;7.07), <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) were factors linked to postoperative nausea and vomiting. Compared to their counterparts, patients who underwent more risky surgical procedures had a 1.4-fold increased chance of developing postoperative nausea and vomiting. Patients who skipped the use of prophylactic medication for nausea and vomiting had a 59% higher risk of experiencing postoperative nausea and vomiting than those who did [OR: 1.39 (95% CI (1.074&#x02013;1.769), <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.012) and OR: 0.194 (95% CI (0.04&#x02013;0.935), <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001)], respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Postoperative nausea and vomiting were more common in surgically treated African individuals. Clinical interventions are needed to prevent, diagnose, and treat postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), with a focus on patients who have experienced motion sickness, high-risk surgery, or PONV in the past. It is advisable to use whole intravenous anesthesia based on Propofol for surgery, if feasible.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>incidence</kwd><kwd>nausea</kwd><kwd>postoperative</kwd><kwd>surgery</kwd><kwd>vomiting</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Vomiting is defined as the violent release of stomach or intestinal contents through the mouth, whereas nausea is defined as an uncomfortable feeling that is connected to the desire to vomit<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. After surgery and anesthesia, nausea and vomiting that worsens within 24&#x02013;48&#x000a0;hours is one of the most uncomfortable side effects that patients encounter<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The vomiting center in the medulla oblongata is the main source of control over nausea and vomiting. It consists of the tractus solitarius nucleus and the reticular formation (NTS). Four main locations can provide signals to the vomiting center: the vestibular region, the cerebral cortex and thalamus, the gastrointestinal tract, and the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CRTZ)<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Indirect signals might also be sent to the vomiting center by irritations. The effects of anesthesia and surgery can have multiple contributing factors that lead to postoperative nausea and vomiting. Patient-related characteristics include young age, female sex, history of severe motion sickness, history of nausea and vomiting following surgery, and non-smoking history<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Postoperative nausea and vomiting have been linked to a number of anesthesia-related risk factors, such as extended anesthesia duration, laparoscopic surgery, and the use of volatile anesthetics and opioids (both intra- and postoperative)<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The frequency of postoperative nausea and vomiting has been documented in a number of European research; the prevalence ranges from 16.8% to 31.4%, with the first 24&#x000a0;hours having the highest frequency<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Evidence from Ethiopia indicated that a study was carried out in Addis Ababa<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> found that 54.3% of patients experienced postoperative nausea and vomiting. Both during the intraoperative and postoperative phases of the procedure, nausea and vomiting can happen. 40.2% of patients who underwent spinal anesthesia had this condition, according to a research done in Gonder, Ethiopia<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Adult patients&#x02019; risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting has been estimated using simplified risk score models, such as the Apfel score. It is assumed that the postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) risk is 10% in the absence of any risk factors. While postoperative opioid use and the presence of one of the four risk variables above is linked to a 20% risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting, the risk rises by 20% with each additional risk factor and reaches 80% if all four are present<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The Apfel grading method does not take ethnicity into account, which may have an impact on the frequency of postoperative nausea and vomiting. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting varied depending on the patient&#x02019;s country of origin, according to a meta-analysis<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting is crucial because it can have negative psychological and physical effects in addition to leading to serious complications like upper airway and postoperative pulmonary complications from aspirating vomitus, pneumothorax, incisional hernia, delayed hospital discharge, and re-admission following outpatient surgery<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Additionally, it has a significant impact on lowering medical expenses, enhancing patient satisfaction, and expediting the return of patients to their regular activities<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In order to improve postoperative nausea and vomiting care, a summary of the problem&#x02019;s magnitude should be available; however, the results of research carried out in various regions of the nation now differ greatly from one another. Studies from Africa are not included in the worldwide systematic review and meta-analysis. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to show the pooled incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in Africa together with its contributing factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study protocol and reporting</title><p>This systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards for the literature search method, study selection, data extraction, and outcome reporting<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.

The source of heterogeneity was also found by meta-regression, which took the sample size and the year of publication into account as factors. The outcome shows that the sample size and the year of publication have no bearing on the degree of heterogeneity amongst studies (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The Egger&#x02019;s test and a funnel plot are used to visually represent the presence of publication bias. An examination of the funnel plot visually revealed an uneven distribution (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which the Egger test (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) indicates is statistically significant. Additionally, non-significant (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05) findings from the Beg test demonstrate the existence of publication bias. Additionally, we performed sensitivity analysis by excluding studies step by step to evaluate the effect of a single study on the overall effect estimate. The result indicated that removing a single study did not have a significant influence on pooled prevalence (Table <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). We also performed a subgroup analysis based on the region in Africa.

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To study postoperative nausea and vomiting among surgical patients in Africa, a systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out. Postoperative nausea and vomiting were estimated to have been 24.96% (95% CI: 17.903&#x02013;32.018), 23.655 % (95% CI: 17.542&#x02013;29.769), and 15.27 % (95% CI: 9.118&#x02013;21.424) in the pooled estimate. The following are factors related to postoperative study.</p><p>Factors such as gender, age, smoking history, surgical procedure, induction agent, inhalation anesthesia, prophylaxis, systemic opioid, motion sickness history, and PONV history.</p><p>Our findings are in line with comparable systematic reviews and meta-analyses conducted in Iran, where the prevalence of nausea and vomiting was found to be 27.7%, 31.4%, and 16.8%, respectively. The decrease in incidence could result from genetic population differences caused by geographic differences; sample size understudied could possibly contribute to the difference<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>One independent risk factor that may influence postoperative nausea and vomiting is the type of operation. Patients who have undergone risky surgeries such as gynecologic, obstetric, ENT, or endocrine have a 1.4 times higher risk of experiencing nausea and vomiting after surgery than patients who have had orthopedic, urological, maxillofacial, or endocrine surgeries. This outcome is comparable to European systematic reviews and meta-analyses<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Nevertheless, this data contradicts a meta-analysis finding that shown a higher prevalence of PONV following surgery for breast and abdominal malignancies than following other types of procedures<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>. In our analysis, abdominal surgery was categorized with other operations that have a higher risk of causing postoperative nausea and vomiting, which could explain the difference in outcomes.</p><p>Propofol induction reduces the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting by 42%. This result is consistent with a report from another study that compared the effectiveness of inhalational anesthetics and Propofol as intravenous drugs. Propofol may reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting because of its antiemetic action on sub-hypnotic dosage induction<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Compared to their counterparts, patients with a history of motion sickness had a 3.2 times higher likelihood of experiencing postoperative nausea and vomiting. This finding is consistent with results from a main study that was published after our data gathering period.</p><p>Patients who receive prophylactic medication for nausea and vomiting have a 42% decreased risk of experiencing nausea and vomiting during the postoperative phase, which is consistent with a German study&#x02019;s findings. This could be because patients who receive prophylactic medication for nausea and vomiting have a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting during the postoperative phase <sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Strengths of this study: It is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to the best of our knowledge on the prevalence and risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting in Africa. A high-standard JBI MAStARI (Meta-Analysis Statistical Assessment and Review Instrument) was employed by the assessors. This study&#x02019;s limitation is that several other research lacked enough predictor factors to accurately assess the degree of prediction The lack of continental representativeness stems from the fact that no data from the northern regions of Africa was found, despite the fact that the demographic characteristics of the population in the North African region were nearly identical to those of the other regions. Nevertheless, efforts were made to include all other potential variables that occurred across the identified database.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This review revealed that research participants have greater rates of postoperative nausea and vomiting. The following were the independent predictors of postoperative nausea: Surgery type, anesthetic medication type, antiemetic prophylaxis, motion sickness history, prior postoperative nausea and vomiting history.</p><p>With a focus on surgery lists such as abdominal, gynecologic, ENT, maxillofacial, history of motion sickness, and history of postoperative nausea patient, there should also be an urgent clinical measure to prevent, detect, and offer prophylactic to avoid postoperative nausea. If the patient&#x02019;s clinical state permits, total intravenous anesthesia based on Propofol may be used during surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all authors of included articles.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Sponsorships or competing interests that may be relevant to content are disclosed at the end of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>Published online 9 January 2025</p></fn></fn-group><sec><title>Ethics approval</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec><title>Sources of funding</title><p>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</p></sec><sec><title>Author&#x02019;s contributions</title><p>M.T. and G.D., selection of study, data extraction, quality assessment, statistical analysis, results interpretation, and writing the initial and final drafts of the manuscript; A.S. and E.H., selection of study, data extraction, quality assessment; W.R. and N.A., statistical analysis, results interpretation, and writing the initial and final drafts of the manuscript; T.D., A.A., W.A., A.U., W.K., A.D., M.S., and A.A., writing the initial and final drafts of the manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest disclosure</title><p>We declare that no conflict of interest exists.</p></sec><sec><title>Registration of systematic reviews</title><p>This review was registered in the Prospero database with reference number CRD 344024.</p></sec><sec><title>Guarantor</title><p>Mebratu Tila Bacho.</p></sec><sec><title>Provenance and peer review</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>If necessary request to the corresponding author to access and use the data, it can be obtained</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stadler</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>
