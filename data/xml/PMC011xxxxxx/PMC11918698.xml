CircRNAs were discovered in RNA viruses for the first time in 1976 and then found in eukaryotes in 1979<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In various DNA viruses such as Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), human papillomaviruses (HPVs), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Marek&#x02019;s Disease Virus (MDV) and Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma virus (KSHV), viral-encoded circRNAs are present. Further evidence showed that circRNA is an important part of the coronavirus transcript<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. on the other hand, these RNAs are created by a mechanism called back splicing, through which, in an RNA molecule, exons or arc-shaped introns at the 3&#x02019; and 5&#x02019; ends are covalently bonded together to form a circular structure. When RNA becomes circular, it is immune to degradation by exonucleases, which, unlike other conventional RNAs in the cytoplasm, makes them highly stable<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. In recent years, RNA sequencing and circRNA-exclusive bioinformatics algorithms have managed to detect thousands of circRNAs in eukaryotic cells such as those of mammals, plants, fish, insects, worms, and fungi. CircRNAs are highly evolutionarily conserved between species. For example, a large number of circRNAs are expressed in both human and mice. Most circRNAs arise from known protein-coding genes and contain one or more exons<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. The length of circRNAs in eukaryotic cells varies from about 100 bp to approximately 4000 bp<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Mounting evidence is indicative that circRNAs regulate a variety of cellular processes by acting as miRNA sponges, transcriptional regulators, protein sponges, molecular scaffolds, and protein/peptide translators<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. In addition, some specific circRNAs have been reported to play an essential role in the occurrence, development, and progression of cancer. Recently, it has been found that circRNAs can encode proteins/peptides involved in the pathogenesis and progression of cancer. Since circRNAs often show cell-specific and tissue-specific patterns, and considering that circRNA expression profiles are associated to the diagnosis of a particular type of cancer, circRNAs can also be used to classify and identify different tumor types. Also, the participation of circRNAs in the pathophysiology of various human diseases including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and neurological diseases and other diseases has been reported<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Such unique features of circRNAs make them promising biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of various diseases<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. However, elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms through which circRNAs participate in the progression of various diseases requires further research.</p></sec><sec><title>Types of circRNAs</title><p>Currently, there are three main groups of circRNAs; circRNAs can originate from introns (circular intronic RNAs), exons (exonic circRNAs), or both (exon-intron circRNAs), even tRNA introns can form stable circular RNAs (tricRNA). However, most known circRNAs originate from exons of protein-coding genes<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. CircRNAs are mainly located in the cytoplasm and nucleus, while recently a new type of circRNAs have been identified that are located in mitochondria and are derived from the mitochondrial genome (mecciRNAs)<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><sec><title>Circular intronic RNA</title><p>Circular intronic RNAs, a small class of circRNAs, originated from intronic sequences and known as ciRNAs. Besides, some intronic lariats escape the debranching process during splicing and produce stable ciRNAs that contain a unique 2&#x02019;-5&#x02019; carbon linkage that distinguishes them from exonic circRNAs<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. CiRNAs such as ci-mcm5, ci-sirt7 and ci-ankrd52 are abundant in the nucleus, and are associated with the nuclear insoluble fraction, while their parent mRNAs are predominantly located in the cytoplasm. ciRNAs are also involved in the regulation of their parent gene expression<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Exonic circRNA</title><p>Exonic circRNAs originated from exonic sequences and known as ecircRNAs. EcircRNAs, consisting of one or more exons, make up the majority (over 80%) of circRNAs detected. Exons of single-exon circRNAs are much longer than exons of multi-exon circRNAs, indicating that exon length may also correlate with circularization. ecircRNAs are very stable in cells and are mainly distributed in the cytoplasm and play specific roles in cellular physiology<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Exon-intron circRNAs</title><p>Exon-intron circRNAs, as a particular subset of circRNA, are composed of both exonic and intronic sequences of coding genes and are known as EIciRNAs and are distinct from ecircRNAs, which are composed exclusively of exonic sequences. EIciRNAs, like ciRNAs, are primarily located in the nucleus and promote transcription of their parental genes. EIciRNAs, like ecircRNAs, tend to pair with long introns as well as complementary sequences, suggesting that the mechanism of EIciRNA formation should be similar with that of ecircRNAs, although the intron is preserved by an unknown mechanism<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>TRNA intronic circRNA</title><p>TRNA intronic circRNAs are a special type of circRNAs that are derived from pre-tRNAs splicing and are formed of intronic sequences and are known as tricRNAs<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Mitochondria-encoded circRNAs</title><p>Mitochondrial genome-derived (mt)-circRNAs (mecciRNAs) are a new type of circRNAs that have been identified recently and are formed of exonic sequences. To date, only four functional mt-circRNAs (mecciND1, mecciND5, mc-COX2 and circRNA SCAR) have been reported<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. MecciRNAs are produced from mitochondrial genes. CircRNAs such as mecciND1 and mecciND5 are encoded by the mitochondrial ND1 and ND5 genes, respectively. These circRNAs can interact with complexes such as TOM40 and PNPase, and facilitate the entry of nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria by serving as molecular chaperones in the folding of imported proteins<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. The circRNA SCAR, located in mitochondria, directly binds to ATP5B (ATP synthase subunit &#x003b2;), blocks mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, and inhibits mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) output and fibroblast activation, acting as a therapeutic target for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. This finding indicates that circRNAs play crucial roles in mitochondria.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Metabolism of circRNA</title><p>In this review, we briefly review recent advances in circRNA metabolism, including biogenesis, localization, and degradation (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Formation mechanisms of different types of circRNAs. (a) ciRNAs formation. ciRNA based on two motifs: one rich in 7 GU nucleotides close to the 5&#x02019; split site and the other rich in C nucleotides close to the branch site, lariat-driven circularization occurs. (b) Exon skipping. An exon-containing lariat which originates from a linear pre-mRNA, through removing the intron sequence following back splicing, leads to the formation of ecircRNA. The introns in these RNA lariat-containing exons though might be conserved to form EIciRNA (exon-intron circRNA). (c) RBP driven circularization. RBPs adhere to particular motifs of neighboring linear pre-mRNA introns and cause interactions between the introns downstream and upstream, and through back splicing, lead to ecircRNA formation. (d) Intron driven pairing circularization. Pairing of inverse repeat elements located at downstream and upstream introns, following back splicing, leads to ElciRNA formation. EcircRNA can be formed via removal of intron sequences of EIciRNA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ms9-87-141-g001" position="float"/></fig>
</p><sec><title>Biogenesis</title><p>The mechanism of circRNA formation is not fully understood; only two models have been reported: the direct back-splicing model and the lariat model. In the direct model, first a back-splicing occurs to form circRNA, and an immature linear RNA containing intron remains. In the case of RNA lariats, back-spliced exons are skipped and extruded, and then an additional back-splicing occurs to remove the intron sequence and thus form ecircRNA<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Localization</title><p>In humans, except for intron-containing circRNAs, most circRNAs are localized to the cytoplasm via the associated RNA helicases, DDX39A (URH49) and DDX39B (UAP56). Short (&#x0003c;400 nt) and long (&#x0003e;1200 nt) circRNAs are transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via URH49 and UAP56<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. Modification of m6A might be involved in circRNA transport as well. A recent study by Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> recognized circNSUN2, an m6A-modified circRNA, which is overexpressed in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). CircNSUN2 export to the cytoplasm depends on modification of m6A and is regulated via YTHDC1 recruitment<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, METTL14 (methyltransferase 14)-mediated m6A modification can promote the cytoplasmic export of circGFR&#x003b1;1<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. Studies have shown that circRNAs can also be actively removed from the cell through extracellular vesicles, including and microvesicles<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Degradation</title><p>Considering how circRNAs maintain dynamic balance, recent studies have clarified circRNA degradation mechanisms. Degradation of circRNAs in the cytoplasm is performed by three endonucleases including RNase-L, RNase-P, Ago2 (argonaute2)<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. CircRNAs containing m6A are exposed to RNase-P which completely destroys them. RNase-L activated by viral infection also binds to circRNAs, leading to their rapid degradation. In another example, CDR1as bears complementary target sites for miRNA-671. Contact with miRNA-671 causes CDR1as cleavage by Ago2<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. A recent study suggested structure-mediated circRNA degradation by RNA-binding protein UPF1 and its associated protein G3BP1, which binds to highly structured base-pair regions of circRNAs and directs circRNA decay<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CircRNAs expression</title><p>The majority of circRNAs are not expressed together with their parent transcript, except for a few circRNAs which have been reported to be co-expressed with their genes. CircRNAs are generally lowly expressed and often show cell-specific and tissue-specific patterns. Tissue-specific expression of circRNAs is largely related to tissue development and differentiation<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. The circRNA expression profile are different at four stages of cardiac differentiation, from undifferentiated stage to terminal cardiac cells<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. Significant modifications in the expression of circRNA have also been observed throughout various stages in iPSC (induced pluripotent stem cell)-derived cardiomyocytes. RNA sequencing evaluation has revealed that patterns of circRNAs expression are tissue exclusive in both normal fetal and adult tissues such as colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung and stomach, though their relative expression in fetal tissues are higher and more frequent<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>. Nevertheless, some circRNAs have been reported to be expressed independently of their parent genes and at higher levels. CircCDYL, circSMARCA5 and CDR1as are examples of such circRNAs<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>. It has been reported that the highest functional and expressive circRNAs loci in the mammalian brain are higher than those in other tissues such as spleen, kidney, and lung<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. One possible reason is that neuronal genes often have long introns (&#x0003e;10 kb) and the expression of circRNAs can be conserved by long introns<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>. There is increasing evidence to suggest that circRNAs are also highly expressed in the spinal cord and play prominent roles in multiple processes of neurological diseases<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>. Besides, circRNAs are present in various biological fluids including plasma, serum, blood, saliva as well as in bone marrow<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. It has also been reported that exosomes are rich in circRNA. Over a thousand circRNAs have been found in serum exosomes. Some circRNAs can retain their nature in the exosome and act on receptor cells after release<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. Emerging evidence shows that dysregulation of circRNA expression is associated with various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, and diabetes. In this review, we briefly describe the role of circRNAs in these diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>CircRNAs stability compared with linear RNAs</title><p>Because circRNAs lack poly A tail and 5&#x02019; end, they are inherently resistant to mRNA-degrading enzymes (RNase-R and RNase-H exonucleases), which mainly target the 3&#x02019; and 5&#x02019; ends. Due to their resistance to mRNA-degrading enzymes, circRNAs are highly stable in cells and their median half-life is 18.8 to 23.7&#x000a0;h, while their linear counterpart has a median half-life of 4.0 to 7.4&#x000a0;h<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>. CircRNAs are reportedly 2.5-5-fold more stable compared with their linear counterparts<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. However, circRNAs have a half-life of&#x000a0;&#x0003c;15 s in serum, and the possible reason for this could be the presence of circulating endonucleases<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. There are reports of exosomes bearing twice as many cicrRNAs as cells. Additionally, the ratio of circRNA level to the level of their linear counterparts in exosomes is approximately 6 times higher than in cells, suggesting circRNAs to be contained in exosomes more than linear RNA<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, circRNAs in exosomes are generally stable in serum, because room temperature incubation of up to 24&#x000a0;h had the least effect on the circRNA surface<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. Such traits introduce circRNAs as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for diseases, particularly due to circRNAs&#x02019; presence in plasma.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular mechanism of circRNA</title><p>CircRNAs are capable of performing important funtions. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of circRNAs, such as regulation of gene transcription, activity as miRNA sponge, interaction with proteins, and translation of circRNAs (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There are findings indicating their involvement in immune responses, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and hypoxia.<fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Major roles and functions of circRNAs. Sponge-like role for miRNA and protein: circRNAs can act as sponges for miRNAs and proteins and subsequently regulate their function. Gene transcription regulation: circRNAs can enhance transcription of parental genes by interacting with Pol II. Gene splicing regulation: circRNAs can regulate gene splicing by competing with pre-mRNA splicing. Epigenetic mechanisms regulation: some circRNAs can regulate transcription of parental genes via epigenetic mechanisms. Translation into proteins: through employing different translation elements, IRES and m6A modification serve a critical role in triggering circRNAs translation procedure. Serving as mRNA trap: some circRNAs can serve as an &#x0201c;mRNA trap&#x0201d; by binding to their linear counterpart mRNAs, eventually reducing expression of the proteins. Exportation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm: short (&#x0003c;400 nt) and long (&#x0003e;1200 nt) circRNAs are transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via URH49 and UAP56. Transfer of some circRNAs is dependent on m6A modification and is regulated through YTHDC1 utilization. Exosomal component: circRNAs can be actively transferred to extracellular vesicles. Potential biomarkers: circRNAs are present in body fluids and are investigated as a biomarker to diagnose and treat diseases.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ms9-87-141-g002" position="float"/></fig>
</p><sec><title>Regulation of gene transcription</title><p>CircRNAs act as transcriptional regulators. Contrary to ecircRNAs, predominantly found in the cytoplasm, ciRNAs and EIciRNAs are primarily located in the nucleus, present few miRNA binding sites and play an important role in regulating genes transcription<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. CiRNAs such as ci-ankrd52 and ci-sirt7 accumulate to a large extent at the transcription site and acting as promoter of polymerase II (pol II) transcription, have been associated with elongation Pol II machinery, the suppression of which will lead to a decrease in the transcription level of ankyrin repeat domain 52 (ANKRD52) and sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) proteins, respectively<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, ElciRNAs such as circPAIP2 and circEIF3J connect with RNA pol II, and U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) of promoter regions to promote transcription of parent genes, and knocking down these circRNAs usually reduces the expression of their parent genes<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. CircRNAs have also been reported to regulate transcription of their parental genes through epigenetic mechanisms. For example, circFECR1 demethylates the CpG regions of the DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) promoter by recruiting TET1, resulting in a decrease in DNMT1 protein level. Therefore, circFECR1 facilitates tumor invasiveness by coordinating DNMT1 and TET1 in breast cancer<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, circRNAs can play a key role in transcriptional regulation and regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and splicing levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Activity as miRNA sponge</title><p>CircRNAs activity as miRNA sponge is believed to be their most important role, which is mostly performed by ecircRNAs. By binding to complementary miRNAs, they prevent the binding of miRNAs to the target mRNA and are known as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Single circRNAs are capable of harboring several miRNA binding sites to serve as a sponge to suppress the activity of one or more miRNAs<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. For instance, CDR1as, also known as ciRs-7, encompasses over 70 protected miR-7 binding sites, competitively suppressing miR-7<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup>. CircBIRC6 and circCORO1C promote embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency by acting as miRNA sponge to inhibit mRNA repression of NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4 as pluripotent genes<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. CDR1as, circHIPK3, circCCDC66, circUBE2J2 and circPVT1 and can function as miRNA sponge in cancers. A circRNA can play opposite roles in different cancers by acting as miRNA sponge to several different mRNAs. For instance, circHIPK3 can target miR-7 to boost metastasis and growth of colon cancer, whereas it also targets miR-558 to suppress heparanase expression and inhibit angiogenesis and metastasis of cancer cells in bladder<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. By sponging miR-630 and miR-19b-3p, circMTO1 inhibits their activity and suppresses tumor cell growth in osteosarcoma and rectal cancer, respectively<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup>. However, circMTO1 promotes cervical cancer cell tumorigenesis and chemoresistance via miR-6893 sponge<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup>. Circ-0044516 has been shown to be significantly upregulated in exosomes from PCa (prostate cancer) patients and to promote PCa cell proliferation by acting as a miRNA-29a-3p sponge, and its downregulation can inhibit the malignant behavior of PCa cells<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup>. This means that all these studies provide new potential targets for the prevention and treatment of various diseases, including cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction with proteins</title><p>Some circRNAs contain motifs for RBP-binding and can act as a sponge for RBPs. In addition, circRNAs have been reported to play an important role in regulating cellular events through interaction with RBP<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. For instance, circFoxo3 interacts with various RBPs to block cell cycle progression and lead to cell aging<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup>. Also, circAMOTL1 plays a crucial role in wound healing via interaction with RBP<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup>. The second intron excised from the insulin gene was recently reported to form a stable ciRNA (ci-Ins2/ci-INS), which impacts insulin secretion by interacting with the RBP TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43)<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup>. MecciND1 and mecciND5 play important roles in RBPs transport. MecciND1 can interact with RPA70/RPA32 (replication protein A70/32), which are involved in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, and promote their entry into mitochondria. Knock-down of meccinND1 reduces mtDNA copy number, which may affect mitochondrial homeostasis, while MecciND5 can interact with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-A/B family (hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2B1, and hnRNPA3) and facilitate their mitochondrial import<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. Nuclear genome-derived circPUM1 has been shown to regulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by interacting with important mitochondrial proteins including UQCRC2 (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 2) in mitochondrial complex III<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, circRNAs can bind to related proteins in the signaling pathway and play a pivotal role in inhibiting or promoting cancer<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup>. For instance, circCcnb1 can counteract the effects of p53 mutation in breast cancer by interacting with the Ccnb1 (Cyclin B1) and Cdk1 (cyclin dependent kinase 1) proteins<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. The above studies show that circRNAs can have various biological functions by interacting with proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Translation of circRNAs</title><p>CircRNAs do not possess the elements essential for Cap-dependent translation, including poly a tail and 5&#x02019; cap, and were firstly described as a seperate group of ncRNAs which do not have the capacity to be translated into proteins. In a study by Guo <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>, it was reported that most circRNAs provide no proof of translation<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup>. Nevertheless, more recent studies provided evidence on the capability of some circRNAs to be translated into proteins. Molecular mechanisms for translation initiation of circRNAs by cap-independent mechanisms that can be mediated through internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or occur following the splicing of N6 methyl adenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) in the 5&#x02019; UTR region. Therefore, exons containing AUG inside circRNAs are capable of being translated into small proteins<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Another study by Yang <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> suggested that m<sup>6</sup>A-containing sequences are involved in initiating the translation of circRNAs through the use of different translation elements<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup>. Nevertheless, early proof of circRNAs translation in eukaryotic cells has been attributed to circZNF609<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. To date, a small number of endogenous circRNAs such as circZNF609, circMbl, circFBXW7, circPINTexon2 and circSHPRH as well as circCFLAR, circSLC8A1, circMYBPC3, circEIF6 and circRYR2 have been shown to act as protein templates<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup>. The subsequent experimental studies on the molecular mechanism of circEIF6 demonstrated that circEIF6 interacts with ribosomes and is translated into a novel 224-amino-acid peptide called EIF6-224aa<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup>. PINT87aa, a circPINTexon2-derived polypeptide, binds to PAF1 (polymerase-associated factor 1) to interact with target gene promoters and reduce the elongation efficiency of Pol II, and as a result, the expression of some oncogenes such as MYC, SOX-1, and CPEB1 is reduced<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup>. Recently, a new protein called E-cadherin protein variant (C-E-Cad) translated from circE-cadherin has been identified, which promotes glioblastoma (GBM) cells tumorigenicity through activation of EGFR-STAT3 signaling<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup>. A nascent protein, SMO-193a.a, encoded by circSMO, is reported to be essential for the activation of Hedgehog signaling and GBM tumorigenicity<sup>[<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, several circRNAs, such as circDMD, circFMN, and circMBL act as &#x0201c;mRNAs Trap&#x0201d; that bind to their linear counterpart mRNAs, ultimately reducing protein expression levels<sup>[<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, analysis of the site of action of circRNA with mRNA is essential. Blocking the translation process may decrease the expression of proteins, thereby preventing the initiation and progression of cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Immune responses</title><p>Some circRNAs play an important role in immune responses and tumor immunoregulation. For instance, circRasGEF1B controls innate antiviral responses by regulating intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)<sup>[<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup>. Interestingly, in tumor immunity, another hsa_circ_0007456 molecule plays the opposite role. In response to tumor cell invasion, hsa_circ_0007456 mediates tumor immune evasion by sponging miR-6852-3p and regulating ICAM-1 expression<sup>[<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]</sup>. hsa_circ_0001045, GSDMB ecircRNA, and CDR1as can influence several autoimmune diseases by sponging miR-30a, miR-1275, and miR-7, respectively<sup>[<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]</sup>. Thus, circRNAs facilitate immune responses and affect the processes of autoimmune diseases, antiviral immunity as well as tumor immunity.</p></sec><sec><title>Apoptosis</title><p>A number of circRNAs have been shown to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis. CircFoxo3 excessive expression results in Puma and Bax-mediated apoptosis. Contrary to circFoxo3, circUBAP2 has been reported to prevent apoptosis<sup>[<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup>. Molecular mechanism studies of circHIPK3 provide experimental confirmation of the interaction between circHIPK3 and miR-149. Downregulation of circHIPK3 helps to promote cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis through sponging miR-149 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)<sup>[<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, circ_0014130 inhibits apoptosis in NSCLC by sponging miR-136-5p and upregulating BCL2<sup>[<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</sup>. Changes in apoptosis trend are closely associated to cancer progression or inhibition, and circRNAs play an important role in regulating the apoptosis signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Angiogenesis</title><p>Angiogenesis plays a significant role in cancer development. CircFoxo3 has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis, while circZNF292 induces angiogenesis. In addition, circMYLK induces angiogenesis via the VEGFA/VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor A/R2) pathway<sup>[<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup>. During aging, circGSE1 promotes endothelial angiogenesis in mice by targeting the miR-323-5p/neuropilin-1 (NRP1) axis<sup>[<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</sup>. Circ-ASH2L as a sponge for miR-34a promotes angiogenesis and tumor progression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It has been widely reported that miR-34a inhibits angiogenesis by suppressing the Notch1 signaling pathway<sup>[<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]</sup>. CircRNA_002178 causes the proliferation and angiogenesis of breast cancer cells through the mi-328-3p/COL1A1 (collagen type I alpha 1 chain) axis. Silencing of circRNA_002178 delays breast cancer progression<sup>[<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]</sup>. Downregulation of circ_0030998 inhibits proliferation and angiogenesis of CRC cells through sponging miR-567<sup>[<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]</sup>. The above findings show that circRNAs play a significant role in angiogenesis through miRNA adsorption, which can be a potential therapeutic target for angiogenesis-related diseases treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypoxia</title><p>Lately, hypoxia-responsive circRNAs have been identified as a major player in modulating hypoxic responses and promoting the progression and metastasis of hypoxic tumors<sup>[<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]</sup>. Upon hypoxic conditions, tumor cells promote the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; (HIF1&#x003b1;), and transcription of circRNAs is regulated by HIF1&#x003b1; to contribute to tumor responses to hypoxia. For instance, hypoxia-associated circDENND2A enhances glioma cell migration and invasion by directly sponging miR-625-5p<sup>[<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]</sup>. CircHIPK3 serves as miR-338-3p sponge to elevate HIF-1&#x003b1; and promotes growth, proliferation, invasion, and migration of cervical cancer cells<sup>[<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]</sup>. Hypoxic tumor-derived circSETDB1 was found to induce the proliferation and aggressive growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells through the miR-7/specificity protein 1 (Sp1) axis<sup>[<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]</sup>. Hypoxia-induced circRNF13 promotes tumor progression in pancreatic cancer<sup>[<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]</sup>. The function of circRNAs in the proliferation and metastasis of cancers under hypoxia is newly understood. Extensive research is needed to discover new cancer treatment strategies by targeting hypoxia-related circRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Diseases associated with circRNAs</title><sec><title>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease</title><p>Preliminary studies revealed circRNAs to be overly expressed in brain tissues and may participate in the regulation of synaptic function and nerve formation<sup>[<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]</sup>. Recent reports indicate that circRNA play a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases development such as that of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD). When aging, circRNA levels in the brain increase, as well as in age-related neurological disorders such as inflammatory neuropathy, nervous system neoplasms, prion diseases, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, and AD<sup>[<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]</sup>. One prominent circRNA in retina and brain is CDR1as, which can act as sponge for miR-7 to suppress the normal function of miR-7. CDR1as low levels can lead to increased expression of miR-7, which reduces the activity of UBE2A (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 A), which is involved in clearance of toxic amyloid peptides from the AD brain<sup>[<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, circ-0000950, through the miR-103 sponge, increases the apoptosis of nerve cells, suppresses the growth of neurites, and elevates inflammatory cytokines including TNF-&#x003b1;, interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 in AD<sup>[<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]</sup>. Several reports have revealed the function and expression of certain circRNAs to be closely related to autophagy in AD. As an instance, it has been recently reported that circNF1-419 is tightly linked with autophagy in AD. In addition, circNF1-419 was shown to regulate autophagy through connecting with Dynamin-1 and adaptor protein 2 B1 (AP2B1). The results suggest circNF1-419 to possibly hinder AD progression and increase autophagy by increasing interaction with AP2B1 and Dynamin-1<sup>[<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]</sup>. CircRNAs were shown to be associated with AD, which may have therapeutic potentials for this disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Diabetes</title><p>Besides miRNAs and lncRNAs, circRNAs are reportedly involved in metabolic diseases such as diabetes. The eminently known endogenous circRNA for diabetes is currently CDR1as. It can promote islet &#x003b2;-cell proliferation and insulin secretion in diabetics by sponging miR-7 and increasing gene expression of Myrip and Pax6<sup>[<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]</sup>. Indeed, over expression of miR-7a in &#x003b2; cells of transgenic mice induces diabetes due to impaired insulin secretion and dedifferentiation of &#x003b2; cells<sup>[<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]</sup>. CircHIPK3, on the other hand, targets miR-338-3p to mediate secretion of insulin by &#x003b2; cells<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Based on this, it can be concluded that circHIPK3 and CDR1as may be promising therapeutic targets in diabetic patients. The recent research showed that circ_0095008 and circ_0001883 currently can be used as standard biomarkers for early diagnosis of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR)<sup>[<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, circPPM1F overexpression can increase pancreatic islet damage by increasing M1 macrophage activation, and circPPM1F can be a potentially new target for treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D)<sup>[<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]</sup>. The above findings show that dysregulation in circRNA expression is related to pathological conditions including diabetes. Accordingly, many studies have focused on different circRNAs and their related functions in diabetic conditions, hoping to use these circRNAs to predict and treat diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Cardiovascular disease</title><p>CircRNAs have been displayed by numerous recent studies to be involved in a many cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide<sup>[<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]</sup>. CircRNAs are expressed differently in the heart of a healthy and sick person, indicating their role in disease development<sup>[<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]</sup>. CircFNDC3B regulates cardiac repair following myocardial infarction (MI) through the FUS/VEGFA axis. CircFNDC3B overexpression in cardiac endothelial cells elevates the expression of VEGFA, increases their angiogenic contribution, and decreases apoptosis of cardiac cells and endothelial cells. Such findings stress the physiological importance of circRNAs in heart repair and suggest that modulating expression of circFNDC3B might be a promising strategy to enhance post-MI cardiac function and regeneration<sup>[<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]</sup>. CDR1as which has been previously investigated in brain development, has been found to be a harmful factor in myocardial infarction (MI). CDR1as also acts as a potent sponge of miR-7a in heart cells, and increased CDR1as expression can reduce miR-7a activity and lead to the overexpression of miR-7a target expression including SP1 and Poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1), which play a pro-apoptotic role during MI development<sup>[<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, circRNAs are important mediators in the occurrence and development of CVD, and thus are considered promising targets for diagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Gastrointestinal diseases</title><p>With the increasing popularity of circRNAs, they have lately been indicated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases including celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). CircRNAs can act as miRNA sponges to regulate the expression of genes that regulate intestinal barrier function and the immune response<sup>[<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]</sup>. The relationship between celiac disease and other autoimmune diseases, especially T1D, has been shown in studies. Juan <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> reported an increased prevalence of celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes and showed an association between hsa_circ_0004564 and its parental gene RAPH1 in children with T1D possessing celiac disease autoantibodies. Therefore, hsa_circ_0004564 and RAPH1 may be novel potential targets to study immune mechanisms in children with T1D and celiac disease<sup>[<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]</sup>. Differential expression of some circRNAs has been found between IBD patients and healthy individuals. Some of these circRNAs have regulatory effects on IBD development. Evidence suggests that circRNAs have potential applications in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of IBD, and investigating their function in IBD will reveal the mechanisms underlying IBD. The two main types of IBD are Crohn&#x02019;s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Numerous studies have found that circRNA_103516 and circRNA_004662 are highly expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CD patients and may act as biomarkers for diagnosis<sup>[<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]</sup>. Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> showed that circ_0007919 by acting as hsa-let-7a and miR-138 sponge, leads to inhibition of SIRT1 and activation of NF-kB and thus leads to intestinal inflammation in patients with UC<sup>[<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]</sup>. Overall, more research is needed in this field and revealing the role and underlying mechanism of circRNAs in celiac disease and IBD will undoubtedly help to develop effective therapeutic methods.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Role of circRNAs in cancer</title><p>Cancer is one of the most common causes of death in the world and the number of cancer patients is increasing. New treatment strategies are still needed to treat cancer<sup>[<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]</sup>. CircRNAs are recognized as a new area in the field of genetics for the diagnosis of cancer and for the regulation of miRNAs function. Recently, there has been considerable evidence that circRNA expression profiles are associated with the diagnosis of a particular type of cancer<sup>[<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]</sup>. Some circRNAs are involved in the development and progression of cancer, while others suppress tumorigenesis<sup>[<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]</sup>. For instance, by targeting miR-29a, circMYLK upregulates TRAF4 expression in PCa cells, thereby leading to PCa cell proliferation, invasion, and migration<sup>[<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]</sup>. CircBIRC6 plays an important role in breast cancer growth and metastasis formation<sup>[<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, hsa_circ_103820 as miR-200b-3 sponge significantly inhibits lung cancer progression<sup>[<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]</sup>. CircSMAD2 has a tumor&#x02010;suppressive effect by sponging miR-629. This means that the circSMAD2/miR-629 regulatory axis may contribute to tumorigenesis and progression of HCC<sup>[<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]</sup>. Due to the interaction of circRNAs with miRNAs and the consequent effect on the expression level of target genes, the identification of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks has become the goal of cancer research.</p><p>Recently, exosomes have been studied as a therapeutic tool for delivering drugs to specific organs<sup>[<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]</sup>. Hence, delivery of tumor-suppressing circRNAs or circRNAs encoding therapeutic proteins to exosomes can be a new approach for cancer treatment that has recently received attention. Thus, circRNAs are powerful tools for cancer diagnosis and prognosis and could be used to control cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>CircRNAs are another rising star in the family of endogenous RNAs that are abundantly found in the eukaryotic transcriptome. To sum up, our knowledge of circRNAs has been dramatically increasing in recent years. As a stable class of ncRNAs expressed in different cells, circRNAs often show cell-specific and tissue-specific patterns and are evolutionarily conserved between species. RNA sequencing and unique bioinformatics algorithms led to the identification of several circRNA regulatory pathways, one of which is miRNA-mediated regulation. Functionally, endogenous circRNAs contain multiple miRNA binding sites and function as miRNA sponges, to regulate mRNA expression and thereby the physiological state of cells. In addition, some specific circRNAs have been reported to be dysregulated in cancerous tissues and can play an important role in cancer signaling pathways, so influencing tumorigenesis, metastasis, and tumor microenvironment remodeling. Also, some circRNAs have been reported to encode proteins/peptides involved in the pathogenesis and progression of cancer. Many studies have shown signs of the distinct expression of circRNAs and their important role in various diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological diseases, autoimmune diseases, etc, hence enabling them to be potentially serve as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, there are still some unsolved problems and many questions and debates about circRNAs. Since the circRNA sequence overlaps with its linear mRNA counterpart, the identification and study of circRNAs is a challenge. Therefore, circRNA identification, characterization, and assessment methods all depend on the specific binding. Undoubtedly, addressing these issues in future research can help to the development of methods for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of diseases, including cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Sponsorships or competing interests that may be relevant to content are disclosed at the end of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>Published online 9 January 2025</p></fn></fn-group><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Dezful University of Medical Sciences, Dezful, Iran (ethical approval code of IR.DUMS.REC.1403.032).</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec><title>Sources of funding</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contribution</title><p>All authors participated in writing and revising the manuscript.
