Few (57, 30.32%) considered academic load as a barrier, and only 20 (10.60%) were not actively promoting PA engagement to others. Most PA participants were males (57.14%), leaning toward group-based activity (54, 59.34%), making regular plans (51, 56.04%) and motivated by self-health promotion (86, 94.51%) (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). Despite majority of students (82.98%) agreement on PA&#x02019;s benefits, nearly half (51.60%) do not engage, Similarly, overall advocacy for PA promotion in relation to specific people was not statistically significant (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.21). Embedding PA into undergraduate curriculum, use of PA report cards, exercise prescription training and targeted mentoring, in addition to digital bracelets, smart phone applications and internet-based social media, had positive impact on PA participation and promotion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Medical students&#x02019; understanding of PA health related significance did not equate to increase engagement, despite active promotion.

However, only those from third, fourth, and fifth years were included. First- and second-year students were on leave and were not regularly attending the university at the time of the study, as they had a relatively different calendar timetable, and sixth-year students were occupied by ongoing end term exams. Therefore, they were not included in the study. It is relevant to mention that during the COVID-19 pandemic, university timetables were continuously adjusted according to local recommendations. Total population was divided into homogeneous strata, in accordance with year of study, then simple random probability sampling technique was implemented to reach a proportionate size out of each stratum. The total sample size was 188 (third-year students = 44, fourth-year students = 82, and fifth-year students = 62), and was calculated using a standard statistical formula, with a determined 95% confidence level, a 50% population proportion, a 5% margin of error, and a total population size of 350 (third-year students&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;79, fourth-year&#x000a0;students =&#x000a0;149, and fifth-year&#x000a0;students =&#x000a0;122).</p></sec><sec><title>Data acquisition</title><p>Data were collected using close ended structured questionnaires, delivered to students after obtaining verbal consents, with appropriate explanation of its content to eliminate chances of misinterpretation. Questionnaires were handed in-between classes when all students where inside the classroom, and filling was done by the students while collectors where available for answering queries. All data collectors were medical students, with no involvement of teachers, supervisors nor professors, in order to limit possibilities of involuntary student participation. Verbal consent was obtained from each student by data collectors by verbal communicating the purpose of the study and asking for their voluntary consent to participate prior to handing them the questionnaire and was documented separately to maintain anonymity.</p><p>The questionnaire was constructed by the authors using relevant background information, with parts being adopted, after modification, from the IPAQ, namely those pertaining to the WHO recommendation on minimum weekly hours. Simple face validation was performed prior to data collection. However, validity of the questionnaire was not tested further, and no further validation nor approval of the questionnaire were sought from national institutions.</p><sec><title>The International PA Questionnaire (IPAQ)</title><p>Initial development of the IPAQ was commenced in Geneva in 1998, as an instrument for measurement of PA participation level<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.

The primary motivator for participation in PA is promoting personal health, while a few students participate for social reasons or follow medical advice.

This finding has been demonstrated in the past, as sedentary behavior was prominent in similar populations<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, the drastic impact of the corona virus diseases (COVID-19) pandemic further escalated lack of PA participation, as demonstrated recently in a study involving Italian medical students<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, demographic findings suggest that males are more expected to engage in PA (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). However, previous evidence, from a Canadian study, found that female medical students are more motivated to promote and advocate for PA participation<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The relatively low frequencies of daily PA engagement (14 out of 91, 15.38%), with a minimum of one hour per session (24 out of 91, 26.37%) amongst PA participants, suggest that less than one tenth accommodate the minimum WHO PA guidelines recommendation. Though the traditional IPAC was not utilized unaltered. Contrary to this finding, a recent study in Saudi Arabia demonstrated significantly higher proportions achieving WHO recommendations, despite the prominence of sedentary behavior<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup>. This answers one of the main objectives of the study, as students&#x02019; level of engagement in PA in not significantly high, and is closely similar to a number of finding reported in the past.</p><p>Furthermore, the relative tendency to adopt a group-based approach when engaging in PA signifies the importance of social interactions as a potential influencer, despite lack of responses expressing socialization as a possible motivator (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05%) (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Moreover, targeted utilization of social media, which has significantly impacted young adults, was found by a Serbian study to increase the likelihood of sufficient PA participation<sup>[<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]</sup>, in addition to quality of life enhancement when used to facilitate combined exercise interventions<sup>[<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Medical students&#x02019; engagement in PA does not seem to be significantly interfered by their academic responsibilities. These further complements previous findings demonstrated by an Indonesian study highlighting the positive influence of PA on burnout stress outcomes associated with the relatively high academic load in medical education<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup>.
</p></sec><sec><title>Medical students&#x02019; perspective</title><p>The acceptable degree of understanding of PA related health benefits, and preventive roles, demonstrated in this study, reflects an adequacy of background knowledge resembling that of recent findings from a scoping review on medical schools from Singapore and the UK<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. However, a quarter of those who do not participate also do not think PA is useful in disease prevention, suggesting potential rejection of an evidence-based approach.</p><p>A consequently expected action, therefore, is advocacy through active promotion, though knowledge does not always equate to action. However, its apparent limitation within the zone of family and relatives, may be explained by the relatively focused social interactions. Moreover, recent evidence from a Canadian study suggested that implemented measures aiming for more PA involvement impacts students&#x02019; promotional attitude<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. The effect of active PA participation on active PA promotion is therefore apparent, yet not significantly high. Converse, wider advocation may also positively affects future practice of PA prescription. A previous survey highlighted residents&#x02019; expression of their desire for training in exercise prescription, despite adequate background knowledge, which sheds light on the significance of systematic curricular development<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup>. In support of this evidence, even among students, in this study, who do not participate in PA, few do advocate to others, reflecting that advocacy and promotion could potentially be independent from active PA engagement. Therefore, linking PA engagement to students&#x02019; perspectives in this study provided additional understanding of the absence of dependence on both.</p><p>The unique considerations of undergraduate medical education that are derived from a relatively bulky academic load, including preclinical and clinical studies, makes it perceivable as a potential barrier from sufficient PA participation, as found in this, and previous studies. However, the level of resilience demonstrated by medical students in the past, and continues to be, acts as a buffering utility by which they succeed in adaptation and accommodation<sup>[<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Impactful innovation in medical education</title><p>Recent enlightenment of medical institutions on the need for contemporary increments in PA engagement amongst undergraduate medical students, lead to the development of novel educational strategies aiming to achieve this goal, such as embedding of PA within the curriculum of several medical schools<sup>[<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>-<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]</sup>, including positively impact on students&#x02019; fitness, found by a Colombian study<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Recent movements for PA integration in undergraduate medical education curriculum were adopted at an authoritative level, such as recommendations commissioned by Public Health England<sup>[<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</sup>. As significant portion of students seen in this study did not consider their academic load a potential barrier for PA engagement, this recent movement may smoothly integrate in future developments. Moreover, a recent Delphi study explored the feasibility of integrating an exercise medicine syllabus into undergraduate medical schools&#x02019; curriculum and found a promising level of acceptance in the UK<sup>[<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]</sup>. It is relevant to mention that the university where the study took place organizes occasional competitive sport events where students could voluntarily participate. However, no official curricular PA integration where implemented.</p><p>On a broader level, the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine advocated for the development of core curricula for both US medical schools and residency programs, which was endorsed by the Canadian Academy of Sport and Exercise Medicine, in an effort to enhance PA engagement and promotion within medical education<sup>[<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, strategic utilization of newly designed mentoring programs, as well as monitoring and surveillance integrated tools, further compliments educational strategies. A recent survey from Taiwan evaluated a redesigned clinical mentoring program launched in a medical Center, incorporating mentor qualifications, enhancers for mentee relationship with mentors, performance evaluation, and incentives, and was found to significantly improved overall performance<sup>[<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]</sup>. Its implementation for PA engagement, however, warrants further assessment.</p><p>Additionally, a mixed methods study in Thailand introduced, and assessed a newly developed tool, the Medical School PA Report Card, and highlighted the need for an improved environmental quality in order to establish PA promotional policies<sup>[<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, a recently developed learning objectives for physician education in PA counselling and prescription, were implemented in several Canadian medical schools in order to enhance medical students&#x02019; promotional attitude<sup>[<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, a recently developed e-learning resource (MEdic GAming, MEGA) was qualitatively evaluated in a UK medical school in order to understand medical students&#x02019; perspective. However, they felt the need for an approach blended with face-to-face PA learning<sup>[<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Technology and AI-driven PA incorporation</title><p>Technology-based PA interventions were demonstrated in the past to possess significant PA promotional value. Among them, active video games, VR, smart mobile phone applications, social media and videoconferencing were shown to increase the PA level of participation, as well as mental health<sup>[<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]</sup>. Recent evidence suggested beneficial outcomes when they are offered to both patients post bariatric surgery, and those with chronic disease<sup>[<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Moreover, mobile applications, internet-based platforms and devices, such as activity bracelets, constitute essential behavioral strategies including goal marking, self-monitoring and self-directed feedback<sup>[<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]</sup>. A recent systematic review highlighted a specific incremental impact of smartphone applications on PA engagement, which is considered an accessible and feasible utility<sup>[<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]</sup>. This sheds light on the effect of access to such facilities, with may be accessible to more financially capable students, on the level of PA engagement.</p><p>Newer technology-based intervention, such as VR incorporated bike exercise was recently assessed among college students in comparison with traditional utility. It was found to be a potentially effective, enjoyable, and motivating PA tool<sup>[<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]</sup>. Though further diverse evaluation of its efficacy is still warranted.</p><p>AI is an innovative technology that is rapidly transforming the medical education landscape. AI can evaluate curriculum effectiveness and assist students in receiving tailored learning content enhanced by their feedback, in addition to support provision for educators<sup>[<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]</sup>. However, the possibility of error alongside its relatively high cost and the need for special training on its use, may hinder wider use amongst medical institutions.</p><p>The current application of AI in medical education is focused on clinical specialty training. Furthermore, evidence suggests that medical students have increased interest in addition of AI related courses to the medical curriculum<sup>[<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup>. This sheds light on the possibility of AI-driven PA tools integration into the medical curriculum as a potential participation and an enhancer for PA promotion. Thus, further studies on this particular role are warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The exclusion of first- and sixth-year students from study, may have hindered production of results representative of the intended population, as comparison was not performed between pre-clinical and clinical medical students. Moreover, the short duration of the study, and the need for a larger sample study may have affected power of the study. Furthermore, utilization of a structured questionnaire, which was constructed by the author, instead of the validated unaltered form of the IPAQ during data acquisition, though outside the scope of the study, alongside lack of additional validation and testing of the utilized questionnaire, may have concealed additional statistically significant outcomes, in addition to limiting the possibility of generating a more specific targeted conclusion. Additionally, this study utilized statistical analysis techniques confined to descriptive analysis and chi-square tests, which may have limited the strength of the study. Therefore, future studies should utilize them to assess level, degree and promotional attitude of PA participation amongst medical students, with additional focus on when they use technology-based and AI-driven PA instruments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The acceptable background knowledge of medical students and understanding of promotional and preventive significance of PA, does not necessarily equate to an applaudable level of engagement. Moreover, medical students agree on potential positive benefits of PA, yet their promotional advocacy involve a more focused environment.</p><p>Previous evaluations suggest that systematic integration of PA into medical education curricula, bearing in mind contextual diversity, may positively impact their level of participation. Future studies should assess innovative strategies, such as targeted mentoring programs, PA report cards and exercise prescription training in the context of medical education. Additionally, comparative studies should be considered to differential level of PA engagement and promotion in institutions with PA integrated curriculum.</p><p>Furthermore, future studies should also evaluate the influence of technology-based and AI-driven PA on medical students&#x02019; PA engagement, focusing on feasible utilities such as smart phones, as it has shown promising results in different populations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Appreciations toward Nile university for encouraging research, and toward all students who participated in this study.
