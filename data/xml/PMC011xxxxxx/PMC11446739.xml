Several studies point out that alexithymia disrupts the ability to identify feelings of others (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). From an etymological point of view, the word comes from Greek: a = lack, lexis = word, and thymos = mood or emotion. Thus, it can be translated as the inability to read and express emotions. The term was coined during the 1970s by two psycho-therapists (Peter E. Sifneos and John C. Nemiah), looking to summarize symptoms they had noticed in their patients suffering from psychosomatic illnesses (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). More recently, there has been a growing scientific interest in the way alexithymia affects interpersonal relationships, with some authors hypothesizing that alexithymic individuals have difficulty interacting with others, since alexithymia correlates with emotional skills-related problems, such as difficulties in building and maintaining interpersonal relationships, smaller social networks, and reduced social skills (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Since alexithymia is frequently linked to depressive and anxious states of mind, it is likely that people with alexithymia have trouble controlling their negative emotions (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Alexithymia along with high impulsivity, has been correlated with problematic internet use, consequently raising the theory that people who struggle to identify and communicate their emotions are more inclined to use online video games to escape negative feelings (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Social media has increased over the past years and has been proven to be used as a maladaptative coping mechanism (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The use of emotion- and avoidance-oriented coping strategies is favorably correlated with alexithymia, as assessed by the TAS-20 in teenage samples, and negatively correlated with task-oriented coping strategies (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Di Blasi et&#x000a0;al. view the emotional challenges associated with impulsivity and alexithymic features as specific elements that constitute an emotion dysregulation process (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In alexithymic individuals, restricted and intolerant attitudes toward their own short-comings and limitations, as well as a failure to recognize themselves as a part of the larger human condition, go alongside a constricted awareness of emotions in self and others (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Therefore, maladaptive coping mechanisms, such as drinking and negative emotional states, like despair, anxiety, and stress can be frequently linked to alexithymia (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>The prevalence of alexithymia in the general population is estimated to be around 10% (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Some researchers established that this deficiency exists in both healthy and unhealthy individuals (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), characterized by difficulties in identifying, analyzing, and ex-pressing emotions, as well as involving certain restrictions, in terms of externally oriented thinking and imagination. A 5-year follow-up study in the general population has indicated that alexithymia can essentially be considered a stable personality trait (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). There are different theories regarding the emergence of alexithymia, with some studies showing that childhood trauma is a substantial contributing element (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Some authors suggest that childhood trauma, including emotional abuse and severe emotional and physical neglect, can predict the emergence of alexithymia in later life (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>According to the research examining the relationship between alexithymia, social media use, and smartphone addiction, there was a strong correlation between alexithymia and the severity of smartphone use (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>The ability to identify and control one&#x02019;s own emotions as well as those of others is known as emotional intelligence (EI). On the other hand, empathy is the capacity to comprehend the feelings of others, and alexithymia is the inability to feel and communicate emotions verbally. Emotional intelligence is a crucial prerequisite for success in the medical field (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>Empathy has a multidimensional character, comprising cognitive and emotional dimensions. It includes the ability to perceive the perspective of others, correctly identify their subjective reality, and have appropriate affective responses that follow the perception of the emotional states of those around us (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Empathy has two components: affective, which comprises the individuals&#x02019; capacity to feel what others feel; cognitive, which is the ability to identify, interpret and understand the mental states of others, which involves perspective-taking (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Empathy helps create and maintain these social connections, allowing people to understand, share and respond accordingly to other people emotional states (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>In healthcare, the professional-patient relationship is primarily based on empathy, as this can help build trust and improve communication, thus creating a safe environment to explore existing possibilities and make the best medical decisions (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Alternatively, a healthcare professional showing high levels of empathy has been shown to help reduce patients&#x02019; stress levels, as well as their anxiety and depression, as well as improve their prognosis (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>As medical professionals on the frontline of dealing and acting immediately and without fail for the most vulnerable, doctors must be highly specialized. On the path to-ward developing their medical career, medical students must spend significantly more time acquiring the required professional knowledge. Research suggests that this particular area of expertise involves significantly higher academic pressure than other disciplines (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Keeping this in mind, it becomes somewhat inevitable to logically infer that, as a direct cause of these inherent and long-term pressures, medical students are at a high risk of developing mental health issues, such as burnout, anxiety or depression (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), as alexithymia is a recognized risk factor for these mental health difficulties, particularly in health science students (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). These facts indicate that alexithymia may negatively impact the health professional-patient relationship, starting early on and notable in medical students&#x02019; personal and professional lives (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, socializing via the Internet has become an increasingly integral part of young adults&#x02019; lives. Social networking sites are online communication tools that allow users to create a public or private profile to interact with others. Although they have helped people connect in new and innovative ways, several researchers have pointed out that excessive use of social networks has negative health consequences, including structural and functional changes in brain regions involved in emotional processing, attention, decision-making, and cognitive control.</p><p>Pertaining to our subject at hand, there are differing views regarding the correlation between social media use and empathy. Various studies have noted that empathy is negatively correlated to social media addiction (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), as, according to Dailey (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), empathetic individuals are less likely to develop a social media addiction.</p><p>However, certain studies have suggested that this is an indirect connection (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), some authors have demonstrated the opposite (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), while others have highlighted mostly a neutral relationship between the two (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p>This study aimed to explore if high values of alexithymia in medical students correlate with low values of empathy, and to identify any potential connections with social media addiction. We hypothesized that alexithymia mediates the relationship between social media addiction and the degree of empathy in undergraduate medical students, all of which are elements that may influence future medical careers, since these factors influence how we relate to those around us.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study population consisted of 649 medical students in their 4th, 5th, or 6th year of studies, recruited between March and May 2021.

The Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ) was priorly validated in Romanian (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and measures the empathy level as a uni-dimensional instrument, consisting of 16 items, with a 5-point Likert scale-type answer: never, rarely, sometimes, often, always, and with scores ranging from 0 to 4. Total scores range from a minimum of 16 to 64 points. The validation study for TEQ in Romanian (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) reported a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.727 and an ICC of 0.776. The validation of TEQ was conducted using the same sample as in the current study.</p><p>The Social Media Addiction Scale-Student Form (SMAS-SF) was developed by Sahin et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) and was previously validated in Romanian (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The questionnaire consists of 29 items with a 5-point Likert scale, from &#x0201c;totally disagree&#x0201d; (1 point), &#x0201c;disagree&#x0201d; (2 points), &#x0201c;neither agree nor disagree&#x0201d; (3 points), &#x0201c;agree&#x0201d; (4 points), &#x0201c;totally agree&#x0201d; (5 points). The total score ranges from a minimum of 29 to a maximum of 145. The total score can be interpreted as: no addiction (&#x02264; 58 points), mild addiction (59-87 points), moderate addiction (88-116 points), and severe addiction (&#x02265; 117 points). The validation of the SMAS-SF in Romanian (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) demonstrated a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.817 and an ICC of 0.829 and used the same sample as in the current study.</p><p>The Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) was developed by Bagby et&#x000a0;al.

Alexithymia, as measured by this instrument, is characterized by three factors. The first, entitled &#x0201c;difficulties in identifying feelings&#x0201d; (DIF), and the second factor, entitled &#x0201c;difficulties in describing feelings&#x0201d; (DDF), refer to emotional awareness and expression. They might, therefore, be considered as &#x0201c;affect-related&#x0201d;. The third factor, entitled &#x0201c;externally-oriented thinking&#x0201d; (EOT), refers to a specific tendency to deal with simple themes and to avoid affective thinking. Possible answers are quantified on a 5-point Likert scale, from &#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; (1 point), &#x0201c;disagree&#x0201d; (2 points), &#x0201c;neither agree nor disagree&#x0201d; (3 points), &#x0201c;agree&#x0201d; (4 points), &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d; (5 points). We employed the recently validated Romanian version (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) for this study. Total scores ranged from 20 points, as a minimum, to 100 points as a maximum. Scores were classified as non-alexithymia (&#x02264;51 points), possible alexithymia (52&#x02010;60 points), and alexithymia (&#x02265;61 points) (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The validation study in Romanian (Morariu, 2013) reported a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.83.

The categorical variables are represented as absolute and relative frequencies, and continuous variables are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). A p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Since the data were not normally distributed, we used the Mann-Whitney test to test for differences between males and females for total scores. The degree of correlation between different questionnaires was test-ed with the Pearson point product correlation. Using structural equation modeling, we created a pathway analysis investigating alexithymia as a mediator between social media addiction and the degree of empathy in medical undergraduates.</p><p>The mediation model was analyzed using sgmediation2 command in Stata.

In this complex inter-play, empathy plays an essential role, found at the core of the therapeutic relationship, and the essence of the doctor-patient relationship. Being able to place oneself in someone else&#x02019;s place can be challenging, especially when the other is suffering. However, instrumental, as it is the only way to more precisely try to understand what that the other is going through.</p><p>The present study examined the relationships between alexithymia, social media addiction, and empathy using validated self-administered questionnaires for medical students. People with alexithymia experience difficulties understanding their feelings, as well as those of others, which could result in limitations in the empathic abilities of alexithymia individuals. On the other hand, in the workplace, they also experience difficulties in being able to socialize with colleagues, as they seem inexpressive, aloof, which, in turn, leads to a high probability of becoming unemployed (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p><p>There are several studies that suggest alexithymia plays an important role in the etiology of addictive behaviors (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Social media is what facilitates interpersonal relationships, which can lead to addiction in people with a high level of alexithymia.</p><p>Both empathy and alexithymia are necessary qualities for someone looking to pursue a future medical career. When considering the question of the reasoning behind that, the most likely answer is that empathy allows the building of relationships, and facilitates understanding what patients think, thus making it easier for healthcare workers to respond appropriately. Empathy allows us to manage what we feel, even when faced with stressful situations, without being overwhelmed (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Moreover, empathy is what allows us to offer unconditional and disinterested help to another.</p><p>In our study, the total TEQ score was 48.76 &#x000b1; 5.65, which is slightly higher than those reported in the literature. Differences between women and men were also significant, favoring the former. A recent study carried out in 57 countries, in 2022, reached the same conclusions, namely that women, regardless of their age and country of origin, scored higher than men in the &#x0201c;Reading the Mind in the Eyes&#x0201d; test, used on a broad scale, to measure the degree of &#x0201c;cognitive empathy&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).</p><p>In this study, the prevalence of medical students with alexithymia was of 14.01%, slightly higher than that reported in the general population (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), but lower than those reported in other student populations (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). For someone with alexithymia, understanding one&#x02019;s own emotional issues is problematic, which is even more difficult when dealing with someone else. An alexithymic health professional will struggle in their interactions, ultimately negatively impact the therapeutic alliance and treatment they offer others (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that medical students and health professionals in general should be familiar with the concept of alexithymia and its significance in their own personal and professional lives (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>).</p><p>Among other results, we also found a negative, and significant correlation between the TEQ Scale and the mean TAS-20 scores. Current research supports a cerebral connection between alexithymia and empathy, with the connection established at the level of the insular cortex, where the processing of internal affective states is carried out. The anterior cingulate cortex is associated with emotion processing and social rewards, and a reduced activity in this cerebral area may be associated with alexithymia (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). In this view, those with alexithymic traits will tend to have less empathy. Consequently, young people undergoing healthcare education should determine their own capacity for empathy, and those who struggle in this area should receive specific psycho-education on empathy (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we chose to position the personality trait as a mediator rather than a predictor due to specific theoretical considerations. While personality traits are generally considered stable and develop early in life, recent research suggests that they can also be influenced and shaped by environmental factors and behaviors acquired later in life, such as social media use. For instance, there is evidence that frequent engagement in certain behaviors can reinforce or even modify certain personality traits over time, suggesting a bidirectional relationship (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Valdespino et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) have explored the temporal relationship between alexithymia and empathy, demonstrating that alexithymia serves as a precursor to empathy abnormalities. Therefore, in our theoretical model, social media use is posited as an influential factor that could shape personality traits, thereby justifying its role as a predictor.</p><p>Our path analysis model showed that alexithymia is an essential mediator between social media addiction and empathy. Empathy implies one&#x02019;s capacity to adopt and understand another&#x02019;s experiences and emotions. Secondary to their difficulty in identifying and describing emotions, people with alexithymia might find it strenuous to imagine and perceive the emotional experiences of others. In terms of virtual communication, social media rarely offers non-verbal clues, such as facial expressions, body language and tone of voice, essential elements on which communication skills are built and how we, as a species, have learned to understand emotional states in others. Also, social media usually offers curated, unrealistic portrayals of life, as well as acts of aggression, which some-times surmount current constrains and policies, subsequently being responsible for traumatic effects on their consumers. Thus, this confirms studies showing that maltreatment and trauma may be a contributing factor in alexithymia (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>).</p><p>For people with alexithymia, who struggle on a daily-basis to accurately interpret said clues, the interposition of social media raises their inaccurate interpretation of other people&#x02019;s emotions, and lowers their empathy. Increasing the overall time spent on social media might impair empathic responses and reduce the quality of social interactions. According to certain clinical studies, people suffering from social media addiction also have lower empathy levels (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>), adding to the well-established theory that empathy correlates with social relationships (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>).</p><p>Although the present study shows that alexithymia can mediate the relationship between social media use and empathy, it is not the major determining factor, since there are specific individual coping mechanisms, and characteristic personality traits, which can also influence the dynamics of this relationship.</p><p>The present research has several limitations, the main one being that it was con-ducted in a single location, on a population with shared cultural traits. Although alexithymia is a mediator of empathy, only about 11% of the variability in empathy is explained by this model. Since the SRMR was zero, other factors should be considered in the future. The study was performed on medical students, so conclusions cannot be extended to the general population. However, the number of participants in our study was large enough to consider the results as reliable. For future studies, objective measures and investigator ratings should be added to the assessment of the connections between alexithymia and empathy.</p><p>A significant limitation of this study is the use of cross-sectional data for mediation analysis. While we identified a potential mediating role of alexithymia in the relationship between social media addiction and empathy, it is important to acknowledge that cross-sectional designs limit our ability to infer causality or the temporal order of these relationships. Longitudinal data would be necessary to confirm these mediation effects over time and to establish a clearer causal pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>According to our best knowledge, this is the first paper that analyzes alexithymia as a mediating factor between social media addiction and empathy. Our results indicated a significant negative correlation between empathy and alexithymia in medical students. Alexithymia was a mediator between social media addiction and empathy. Therefore, we recommend timely and specific efforts to identify levels of alexithymia in more medical students, which can lead to the design of tailored interventions aimed at increasing emotional awareness and aptitudes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to acknowledge Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara for their support in covering the costs of publication for this research paper.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.
