It is frequently recognised as a high-quality protein source due to its nutritional qualities and favourable sensory properties such as texture and flavour. However, the rising global population has led to a rise in the production and consumption of meat around the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, which in turn has raised environmental concerns regarding the usage of land and water, as well as its impact on pollution and climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, and the loss of biodiversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Recommendations to limit meat consumption have been made because meat is a critical source of protein and in numerous high-income countries, protein utilisation outperforms dietary necessities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Plant-based meat can be an efficient alternative to livestock, as for the production of the primary plant proteins, fats, carbohydrates and vitamins are used. Plant-based meat is defined as a meat-like substance made from vegetarian-friendly ingredients like proteins (from soy and potatoes), fat (from coconut and sunflower oils), carbohydrates (potato starch, corn starch), nutrition additives (yeast extract, vitamins) and flavours (beet juice extract, apple extract and plant hemoglobin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The market for plant-based meat is anticipated to reach a significant milestone of $30.9 billion by 2026<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> due to the rise in the number of vegetarians, vegans, and flexitarians in Europe during the past several years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The switch from an animal to a non-animal diet is also influenced by religious considerations and high production costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Heme-containing proteins are considered one of the crucial flavour and colourant contributors in animal red meat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Also, hemoprotein addition to artificial meat or its analogues has been proven to display great potential to mimic the taste and smell similar to that of traditional meat. There are a number of hemoglobin analogues across many organisms. Leghemoglobins, are present in the root nodules of leguminous plants. Leghemoglobin (legH) is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a food colouring additive and can be used equivalently to hemoglobin and myoglobin in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In plant-based meats legH unfolds upon cooking, releasing its heme cofactor to catalyse reactions that can transform the same biomolecules, isolated from plant-based sources, into the array of compounds that comprise the unique flavour and aroma of traditional meat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The use of legH protein as a food additive also circumvents the contradictions of animal material used in the diet, especially for vegetarians.</p><p id="Par5">Many attempts in biotechnology have already been made to increase hemoprotein yields, thus ensuring the feasibility of such technology for industrial-scale production. For example, to improve heme-containing protein production the addition of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to the growth medium and overexpression of heme transporter genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> was studied, furthermore, other groups studied extracellular hemin addition, which provided only 5&#x02013;10% increase of heme-containing protein mass in respect to the total protein content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In heme-containing protein production, extracellular precursor addition seems to not be an economically feasible approach and further studies should be focused to achieve commercially viable intracellular hemoglobin, myoglobin and legH production through genetic engineering.</p><p id="Par6">Currently, microorganism platforms are the most perspective way of manufacturing legH in commercial amounts, for further integration into plant-based meat. Several legH-producing recombinant microorganisms are <italic>Candida spp.</italic>, <italic>Hansenula spp., Pichia spp</italic>., or <italic>Toruplosis spp</italic>. representatives, which are methylotrophic yeast and can utilize alcohols, also methanol, have been previously used for accomplishing the mentioned tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, alternative microorganisms, like <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis,</italic> which are capable of utilising cheap dairy industry by-products, like cheese whey, have been studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Another study reported that it was possible to increase legH secretion by 83-fold in a genetically engineered <italic>P. pastoris</italic> with respect to the wild-type strain, by overexpressing heme pathways and globin synthesis genes simultaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A recent study demonstrated that by combining systems biology and genetic engineering approaches, heme production can be increased by 70-fold in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. This was done using metabolic modelling coupled with growth-coupled heme production analysis on the genome level, where the most promising analysis results were genetically implemented and experimentally tested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In the last decade, genome-scale metabolic modelling is increasingly being used as an auxiliary tool for facilitating various genetic engineering tasks and for predicting potential effects. Metabolic models effectively encode gene-protein-reaction (GPR) associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and explain genotype&#x02013;phenotype interaction in unicellular and multi-cellular organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Metabolic modelling allows us to predict the organisms phenotypes biotechnological properties and responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and predicts environmental perturbation impacts on the metabolism and potential carbon distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) application in biotechnology already has proven its importance and helped to develop new nutrient uptake innovations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, novel software developments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, created new biotechnology applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">GEM investigation has guided the development of strains with optimised yields of industrial metabolites (e.g., sesquiterpenes, vanillin, bioethanol, 2,3-butanediol, succinate, amorphadiene, &#x003b2;-farnesene, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, 3-hydroxy propionate, fumaric acid)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">One of the most common approaches to metabolic engineering and computational biology during the last decade has spread to link the production of the desired metabolite with coupled growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This method is very effective in new strain design because metabolic production becomes a necessary by-product for cell growth. Furthermore, to increase desired metabolite production yields and production capabilities it is possible adapting laboratory evolution by selecting for maximum growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">Over the past 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;years, the <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> expression system has been extensively used to produce various recombinant proteins for research and industrial applications. This methylotrophic yeast is highly suitable for heterologous protein expression due to several key features: ease of genetic manipulation, high-frequency DNA transformation, cloning by functional complementation, high levels of intracellular and extracellular protein expression, and the ability to perform higher eukaryotic protein modifications (such as glycosylation, disulphide bond formation, and proteolytic processing)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In addition, relatively low levels of native secreted proteins facilitate the purification of the secreted recombinant proteins. Taking into account the economic factors (such as high cell growth in minimal media and high product stability in prolonged processes) and the advanced genetic techniques available, <italic>P. pastoris</italic> is the system of choice for heterologous protein expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

We performed experimental fermentations with <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> strain X-33 containing genome-integrated legH gene (see details Materials and methods). In GEM analyses we assumed that each legH protein contains one heme molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Therefore, legH production is linked to biomass growth and is limited by intracellular heme production.</p><p id="Par17">To develop <italic>P. pastoris</italic> reactions regulation design sets for genetic engineering purposes and increase intracellular heme production rate, we used <italic>P. pastoris</italic> iMT1026 GEM, which consists of 1708 metabolites, 2243 reactions, 2 different biomass compositions for glycerol and methanol fermentation optimisations, has 9 different compartments and transport intercompartment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. iMT1026 model was updated and missing mandatory information filled to be compatible with CobraToolbox 3.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">GEM includes metabolite name, charged formula and compartment name in the cell.

We found, that the growth rate of glycerol was 6.3&#x02013;4.75-times higher (<bold>&#x003bc;</bold>&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.19&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than consuming methanol (<bold>&#x003bc;</bold>&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.04&#x02013;0.03&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), which is in the scope of previously published data (1.7&#x02013;8.5 times faster)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate on glycerol growth was 2.17&#x02013;2.29&#x000a0;mmol*g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> * h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, but CO<sub>2</sub> production was a little less (1.61&#x02013;1.7&#x000a0;mmol*g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> * h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than O<sub>2</sub> consumption (Supplementary Materials <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Data from S6.13 contains detailed GEM constraints from experiments.</p><p id="Par20">After obtaining growth, O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake rates in the glycerol/methanol-driven cultivations, the GEM model was accordingly constrained with experimentally measured exometabolomics data. After <italic>P. pastoris</italic> GEM optimisations, results suggested that the GEM model can achieve a steady state and produce heme. Experimentally <italic>P. pastoris</italic> biomass growth was measured by a turbidity sensor (Optek, Germany) or permittivity probe (Hamilton, Incyte, Switzerland). Both sensors delivered similar tendencies during the first stage of the fermentation (glycerol). However, culture permittivity results started to decrease gradually during the methanol fermentation stage, thus indicating loss of viability when methanol feed was increasing (see materials and methods). The same conclusions have been made by earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, where it was concluded, that extracellular addition of substrates is a less effective strategy and has its limitations in comparison to genetic engineering potential. For example, 70 times increase in heme production was achieved in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> when using GEM-driven metabolic engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Growth coupled analyses of heme production</title><p id="Par21">Thus, the next step in this study was to use <italic>P. pastoris</italic> GEM to make a systemic reaction impact analysis on potential heme production. Previously described experimental and GEM optimisation results comparisons suggested a potential to increase heme production at the expense of biomass production. This could be one of the GEM modelling bottlenecks in the biomass reaction itself. In GEM, a biomass objective function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> exists, which defines necessary metabolic resources for cell process machinery and proliferation needs. But the biomass objective function data, experimentally measured in strict cultivation conditions, is expensive to measure and sometimes even has a large error distribution. Also, it is known that biomass objective function composition and macromolecule weighting factors can change during different environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">In this study, we improved the previously published growth-coupled GEM algorithm and adjusted it to new GEM requirements. To exclude biomass objective function limitations, we decided that growth-coupled GEM algorithm functionality (see materials and methods) will systematically analyse all metabolic reactions' impact on heme production.</p><p id="Par23">The weighted factor shows how much percentage each flux value changes versus the mean value and is summed together. As not all reaction flux changes are in linear (Supplementary Materials 6 Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6.2</xref>), then we summed all reaction changes and calculated the sum of percentages. The bigger the number, the higher the impact on the target product (increased heme production) (Formula (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>)). All genetic regulation suggestions are done using methanol as a carbon source.</p><p id="Par24">As a result, we found the most promising upregulation (33 reactions) (1.47% of total reactions) (Supplementary Materials 6 Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6.7</xref>) and 66 downregulation/deletion (2.98% of total) reaction candidates (Supplementary Materials 6 Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6.8</xref>) (Formula (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>)).

To increase heme intracellular production, the algorithm has suggested upregulating reactions from the dihydroxyacetone cycle combined with glycolysis reactions (Supplementary Materials 6, Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6.1</xref>) and heme biosynthesis pathways: tetrapyrrole biosynthesis II (Supplementary Materials 6, Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6.5</xref>) and aerobic heme b biosynthesis I (Supplementary Materials 6, Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6.6</xref>).</p><p id="Par27">Interestingly the highest step-weighted factor for upregulation is mitochondrial pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase. The conversion of glutamate to proline and vice versa is thought to play a role in ATP increase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. This could be related to 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALASm) (5-AMINOLEVULINIC-ACID-SYNTHASE-RXN), where Succinyl CoA (succoa) (SUC-COA) is consumed in large amounts as a 5-Aminolevulinate (5aop) (5-AMINOLEVULINIC-ACID-SYNTHASE-RXN) precursor. In the mitochondrial TCA cycle- (PWY-5690) Succinate&#x02013;CoA ligase (ADP-forming) reaction (SUCCCOASYN-RXN), which is one of the suggested upregulation reactions is used to produce Succinyl CoA (SucCoA) (SUC-COA) and consume large amounts of ATP (atp) (ATP), which could be a limiting step for improved intracellular heme production if less ATP (atp) (ATP) is available in mitochondria (Supplementary Materials <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref> Formaldehyde assimilation III).</p><p id="Par28">To increase intracellular heme bioproduction the most perspective upregulation reactions are 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALASm), porphobilinogen synthase (PPBNGS), hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), uroporphyrinogen-III synthase (UPP3S) from heme b biosynthesis I pathway (heme-BIOSYNTHESIS-II) (Supplementary Materials 6 Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6.6</xref>) and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UPPDC1), coproporphyrinogenase (CPPPGO), protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPPGOm), protoporphyrin ferrochelatase (FCLTm) from tetrapyrrole biosynthesis II (from glycine) pathway (PWY-5189) (Supplementary Materials 6 Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6.5</xref>), which together forms the heme biosynthesis metabolic pathway (Porphyrin and Chlorophyll Metabolism in GEM). These reactions have one of the highest step-weighted factors and have the highest impact on heme production increase as a whole pathway. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> the <italic>HEM3</italic> gene (in GEM HMBS reaction) was identified as rate limiting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, but recent studies in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> showed that <italic>HEM1</italic> (in GEM ALASm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> is limiting. They analysed single gene upregulation of heme b biosynthesis I pathway (heme-BIOSYNTHESIS-II) and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis II (from glycine) (PWY-5189) pathways and concluded that ALASm reaction upregulation had the most impact on legH production compared to other heme biosynthesis pathway reactions.

The PTM1 and methanol-fed-batch solutions were sterilized by filtration through a 0.2&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m filter.</p><p id="Par77">The fermentations were conducted in a 5 L bench-top fermenter (Bioreactors.net, EDF-5.4/BIO-4, Latvia) with a working volume of 2&#x02013;4 L. The pH was monitored using a calibrated pH sensor probe (Hamilton, EasyFerm Bio, Switzerland) and adjusted to 5.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1 with a 28% NH<sub>4</sub>OH solution before starting the cultivation process and maintained at the set value during fermentation. The temperature was controlled at 30.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, using a temperature sensor and by adjusting the temperature in the vessel jacket. The dissolved oxygen (DO) level was measured using a DO probe (Hamilton, Oxyferm Bio, Switzerland) and kept above 30&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5% by varying the stirrer speed (200&#x02013;1000 RPM) (Cascade 1) or enriching the inlet air with pure O<sub>2</sub> (Cascade 2). A constant air or air/oxygen mixture at a flow rate of 3.0 slpm was maintained throughout the process. A condenser was used to condense moisture from outlet gasses, and antifoam 204 (Sigma) was added when necessary to control excessive foam formation. Substrate feed solutions were pumped using a high-accuracy peristaltic pump (Longer-Pump, BT100&#x02013;2&#x000a0;J, China).</p><p id="Par78">Process O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration were measured in the reactor exhaust gas using an O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> analyser (Bluesens, BlueInOneFerm, Germany). Culture turbidity was estimated using a turbidity probe (Optek, ASD19-EB-01, Germany) measuring the light absorption (transmission) within the 840&#x02013;910&#x000a0;nm wavelength range. Finally, a permittivity probe (Hamilton, Incyte, Switzerland) was used to estimate the viable cell concentration during cultivation.</p><p id="Par79">The cultivations began with a glycerol batch phase. After 18&#x02013;24&#x000a0;h, the batch glycerol was depleted, and a glycerol fed-batch solution was fed into the reactor at a rate of 0.61&#x000a0;mL/min for 4&#x000a0;h, or until an optical density of 100&#x02013;120 was achieved. After a brief feeding pause of 10&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min, to allow the cells to consume all of the residual glycerol, the feed substrate was switched to methanol, and the solution was fed into the reactor at a rate of 0.12&#x000a0;mL/min for 5&#x000a0;h, followed by 0.24&#x000a0;mL/min for 2&#x000a0;h, and finally 0.36&#x000a0;mL/min for the remainder of the cultivation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Analytical measurements</title><p id="Par80">Cell growth was observed by offline measurements of the culture optical density (OD) at a wavelength of 590&#x000a0;nm (GRANAT, KFK-2, St. Petersburg, Russia).

Biomass samples were placed in pre-weighted Eppendorf<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> tubes and centrifuged at 15&#x02032;500&#x000a0;g for 3&#x000a0;min. Afterwards, the supernatant was discarded, the cells resuspended in distilled water and centrifuged once more. The liquid phase was discarded and the remaining wet cell biomass was weighed.
