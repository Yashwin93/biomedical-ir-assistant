Worldwide, many people face barriers to accessing accurate and timely diagnoses. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been utilized for early assessments and outcome prediction to address these challenges. This paper aims to conduct a systematic review to investigate if ML is a promising approach for PTSD diagnosis. In this review, statistical methods were employed to synthesize the outcomes of the included research and provide guidance on critical considerations for ML task implementation. These included (a) selection of the most appropriate ML model for the available dataset, (b) identification of optimal ML features based on the chosen diagnostic method, (c) determination of appropriate sample size based on the distribution of the data, and (d) implementation of suitable validation tools to assess the performance of the selected ML models. We screened 3186 studies and included 41 articles based on eligibility criteria in the final synthesis. Here we report that the analysis of the included studies highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in PTSD diagnosis. However, implementing AI-based diagnostic systems in real clinical settings requires addressing several limitations, including appropriate regulation, ethical considerations, and protection of patient privacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Machine learning</kwd><kwd>Stress and resilience</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202308180002</award-id><award-id>202000810031</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition that may arise after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Symptoms include recurrent memories, negative mood changes, altered arousal and reactivity, and avoidance of triggers, all of which can lead to significant mental and physical health problems, long-term disability, and socioeconomic burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Early diagnosis and intervention are essential for optimizing clinical outcomes and reducing direct and indirect costs associated with PTSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, timely diagnosis is challenging due to the complex clinical manifestations and outdated diagnostic approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Current diagnostic criteria rely on subjective assessment, while objective tests are currently unavailable due to the high cost and reliability concerns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, the symptoms of PTSD may overlap with other disorders, making it difficult to establish a causal link. Therefore, reliable, sensitive, and easy-to-access approaches are needed to improve PTSD diagnosis.</p><p id="Par3">The recent advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has provided a promising avenue to surmount current challenges, including improving the prediction and diagnosis of diseases such as PTSD. Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, emphasizes the cultivation of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from data rather than operate under rigidly explicit instructions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. ML algorithms gain their proficiency by training on extensive datasets. Subsequently, they make predictions or decisions stemming from this training. The overarching aim of ML is to devise models capable of enhancing their precision over time and adeptly handling unseen data. ML encompasses multiple learning types, including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In supervised learning, algorithms are trained on datasets with known outputs. The algorithms are furnished with input data and the correct output to master a generalized correlation between the two. This enables the algorithm to predict unseen data via classification or regression. Established supervised learning methodologies, such as logistic regression (LR), decision trees (DT), and support vector machines (SVM), employ various statistical models to understand the input-output correlations and predict outcomes. To mitigate overfitting and augment accuracy, ensemble ML methods like random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB) have been introduced. Ensemble learning signifies an advanced strategy where a group of models is trained on a common problem. By integrating their results, both the performance and predictive capacity are considerably heightened, surpassing the capabilities of a single model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Unsupervised learning, conversely, uncovers hidden patterns within unlabeled data, commonly used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Analyses of more extensive, complex, and unstructured data, such as images or textual features, necessitate deep learning (DL) models.</p><p id="Par4">DL, an extended version of artificial neural networks (ANN), consists of multiple artificial neuron layers capable of learning more abstract data representations. DL algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and their variations, are frequently utilized in the medical domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Newly introduced architectures like transformers, designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, use a self-attention mechanism and encoder-decoder structure to scrutinize long-term dependencies in temporal samples, such as text or audio clips<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These features have been extensively adopted in the studies selected for this review and have yielded exceptional results in automated PTSD diagnosis. A brief introduction of various typical ML types and models is shown in the figure below (Fig.<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref><italic>Machine learning model types)</italic>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Machine learning model types.</title><p>This figure introduced typical types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

In classification tasks, the most commonly used metrics to evaluate the performances of the models were accuracy (ratio of correct predictions to total number of predictions), precision (ratio of truth positive to total number of positive predictions), recall (ratio of truth positive to total number of actual positive cases; also known as sensitivity), F1-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall), and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (the capability to distinguish different classes; also known as AUC-ROC or AUC). The choice of evaluation method depends on the task&#x02019;s nature and the dataset&#x02019;s distribution. In general, AUC is often used to compare performances between different models. Hence it is the primary measurement we will use to compare proposed models. For medical applications, where the cost of a false negative result can be extremely high, recall should be the main evaluation metric since a lower recall value implies a significant portion of ignored actual positive cases. For imbalanced datasets, where the number of each class varies significantly, the F1 score is essential since it considers both false positives and false negatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. As for regression tasks, measures like mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root means squared error (RMSE) are significant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par11">Further information on research design is available in the <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">Nature Research Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study selection and review process</title><p id="Par12">The PRISMA guidelines were followed in our review of a total of 3186 studies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref><italic>PRISMA flowchart of study selection and review process</italic>).

Our statistical analysis indicates that SVM, DL, and combined models outperform others (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref><italic>Histogram of various ML models with system accuracy</italic>). SVM, a long-standing ML model, remains preferred for ML scientists due to its efficacy and suitability for small to moderate-sized datasets and its relatively low computational requirements. It is beneficial when the predictive features are well-known to the researchers. In recent years, DL models have grown increasingly popular with the expansion of data availability in various domains.

Diagnostic methods like neuroimaging and clinical interviews tend to have limited sample sizes due to the high costs of using specialized equipment and trained professionals. Consequently, the sample sizes for these methods are often small, which can negatively impact the performance of the corresponding ML models. Despite this limitation, data collected through these methods is precise to PTSD as the predictive features strongly correlate with PTSD diagnosis.

Many studies in these categories utilize online datasets or surveys, which are less expensive and allow for the accessible collection of large datasets. Other studies have used GPS information and electronic medical records, which provide access to extensive online databases containing significant amounts of data. More data available can often enhance the performance of the classification ability, particularly for DL models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. However, these data types are less specific to PTSD, and the samples are heterogeneous. Therefore, it can be challenging to extract useful predictive features specific to PTSD screening.

Privacy and security considerations also hold paramount importance. Digital mental health applications must comply with ethical and legal guidelines, prioritizing data security and privacy, particularly for sensitive personal information like medical histories and psychological evaluations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. Unauthorized access, disclosure, and breaches must be prevented to maintain patient trust and promote healthcare engagement. Researchers are encouraged to share only extracted features and modify raw images or audio to remove identifiable information. Regulatory challenges and unresolved liability issues present another obstacle to adopting AI-powered mental disorder diagnoses. These considerations underscore the complex landscape that informs future PTSD classification research. With this review paper, we aim to guide future research in automated PTSD diagnosis, detailing ML model selection, predictive features, sample sizes, and validation methods. The choice of optimal ML models, primarily an empirical process, hinges on data suitability and the availability of computational resources.</p><p id="Par34">Traditional ML models like SVM and ensemble models are recommended for data strongly correlated with PTSD diagnosis and requiring minimal feature engineering, such as neuroimaging data. These models are ideal for initial experimentation due to limited feature engineering requirements and lower computational demands. For intricate data like speech, visual, and textual features which necessitate more feature engineering, DL models or MLPs are often deemed appropriate. These models can parse complex features through hidden layers and activation functions, discerning correlations between the features and PTSD diagnosis automatically. Recently, DL models such as Transformer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and its variant BERT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>, have demonstrated outstanding performance in various NLP tasks, including audio and semantic analysis. These transformer-based models can understand the long-term dependencies in natural language samples via a self-attention mechanism, significantly improving the model&#x02019;s ability to understand the context. Multi-modality ML models, proven effective in mental disorder-related tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>, offer a holistic view by integrating visual, audio, and semantic modalities. This multi-view learning framework significantly enhances the model&#x02019;s capabilities in mental health analysis.</p><p id="Par35">Predictive features vary significantly across diagnostic methods. In neuroimaging, brain regions like the amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and insula provide robust predictive results when captured with fMRI techniques. Including SNI as a predictor is recommended when using MEG scans while exploring QEEG features such as PSD and FC are advised for EEG features. Various speech attributes like acoustic, prosodic, vocal tract, and excitation are important features in clinical interviews. Semantic elements are recommended for clinical interviews and self-report surveys, providing a comprehensive understanding of the individual and enhancing PTSD diagnosis accuracy.</p><p id="Par36">In ML, data sample size and quality are paramount, particularly in medical applications where data acquisition can be complex and costly, often limiting the performance of ML models. Strategies to mitigate these effects include data augmentation techniques that synthesize new samples to enlarge the sample set, and transfer learning, which fine-tunes pre-trained models on smaller datasets. Crowdsourcing is another potential solution, facilitating cost-effective and time-efficient data collection and annotation.</p><p id="Par37">Data imbalance is another challenge that can be addressed via several strategies. Resampling, either through oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class, can balance class distribution but at the risk of information loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is an alternative approach that generates synthetic data for the minority class by interpolating between existing instances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. Ensemble methods, including bagging and random forests, can alleviate data imbalance by aggregating predictions from multiple models.</p><p id="Par38">Model validation is pivotal to ensure ML accuracy and reliability. Validation methods are problem-dependent, with binary classification problems frequently using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and regression problems typically utilizing MSE and MAE. Alternative metrics such as AUC may be more suitable in skewed or imbalanced datasets. Particularly in medical applications, maximizing sensitivity to minimize false negatives is vital.</p><p id="Par39">Cross-validation, a popular technique, reduces model variance by partitioning the data and training the model on some partitions while evaluating others. This provides a robust estimate of the model&#x02019;s performance and offers insight into its generalization ability. K-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation are popular methods, depending on the size of the available datasets and the computational resources. A permutation test is recommended to ensure model reliability and reduce stochastic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. Statistical significance can be determined by evaluating the model on the original and multiple permuted datasets, demonstrating that the model&#x02019;s performance is not merely by chance.</p><p id="Par40">This review has several limitations that need to be acknowledged. Firstly, the screening process only considered articles directly related to PTSD diagnosis, excluding those addressing prediction or identifying individuals at risk of PTSD. Therefore, further research is needed to understand the entire spectrum of PTSD diagnosis and prediction. Additionally, the limited number of articles (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;41) included in this review restricts the ability to provide in-depth recommendations on PTSD diagnosis tasks. Moreover, the variability in sample groups, sample sizes, performance metrics used, and quality across the studies makes it challenging to make comprehensive comparisons and reach a conclusive outcome.</p><p id="Par41">In conclusion, the heterogeneity of the method applied in each study and the lack of raw data limits our ability to conduct a meta-analysis for this review. A comprehensive synthesis and review of 41 studies concerning the automated diagnosis of PTSD using ML techniques were conducted in this study. With the increasing need for more cost-effective, reliable, and efficient methods for diagnosing PTSD, AI presents a promising solution to address this critical challenge, particularly for individuals who face difficulties accessing quality mental healthcare or experience stigma associated with seeking psychotherapy. The studies included in this review demonstrate the potential of AI for improving PTSD diagnostic approaches. To aid future efforts in automating PTSD classification, guidelines for model selection, feature selection, data acquisition, and validation methods are provided. However, despite advancements in meticulous feature engineering and model selection, the practical implementation of these systems still requires improvement. Significant barriers to the widespread clinical adoption and realization of the full potential of AI in early PTSD diagnosis include ethical and privacy considerations and the lack of standard regulations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
