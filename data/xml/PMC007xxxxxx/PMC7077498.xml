To alleviate this issue, advanced and safe materials with fast and highly efficient dye removal should be designed. Great attention has been paid recently to hydrogels based on polysaccharides such as Arabic Gum (AG) grafted with polyacrylamide (PAM) and polyacrylic acid (PAA). These materials combine the merits of natural polymers such as biodegradability and non-toxicity with the high adsorption ability of PAM and PAA towards cationic dyes such as methylene blue (MB). Many previous works have been done to enhance three-dimensional (3D) structure and swelling ability of the graft copolymers by using a crosslinking agent or even adding nanomaterials as a filler inside the hydrogel matrix. However, these additives may negatively affect the adsorption ability, and few previous studies could reach 2000 mg/g of maximum MB capacity removal within a good period of time. In our work, we synthesized partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide grafted Arabic gum (AG-g-PAM/PAA) to have both amide and carboxylate groups. The modified water dissolved graft product undergoes water in oil (W/O) emulsion using paraffin oil as the continuous phase and Triton X-100 as a stabilizing agent; then, the system was inversed to oil in water (O/W) emulsion by increasing the shear mixing rate and cross-linked using Epichlorohydrin (ECH). The precipitated graft product showed hierarchically interconnected micro and macropores&#x02019; sponge like shape with fast water swelling and high MB adsorption capacity (2300 mg g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) after 45 min at near neutral pH conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>arabic gum</kwd><kwd>porous</kwd><kwd>emulsion inversion</kwd><kwd>superadsorbent</kwd><kwd>hydrogel</kwd><kwd>water retention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-polymers-12-00338"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Great interest has been paid recently to environmental issues such as wastewater containing dye pollutants. Dyes such as methylene blue (MB) are extensively used in many industries including leather, textiles, paper, and clothing [<xref rid="B1-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Unfortunately, most of these dyes release into wastewater and persist in the environment due to their high stability to temperature, light, detergents, and chemicals [<xref rid="B4-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For example, because of inefficient textile painting, more than 200,000 tons are lost to effluents every year, which can threaten human health and result in the demise of water ecosystems [<xref rid="B5-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] due to the dyes&#x02019; high toxicity, non-biodegradability, and mutagenic ability [<xref rid="B6-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to fabricate safe material with a fast and highly efficient ability to protect water resources from dyes and pollutants. As a result of many efforts, adsorption treatment for wastewater dye removal is considered to be a promising candidate strategy which has attracted the interests of many scientists in recent years [<xref rid="B7-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Adsorbents including carbon, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, and nanocomposite hydrogels have been used for wastewater dye removal without generating secondary toxic byproducts [<xref rid="B7-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Crosslinked hydrogel specifically shows high adsorption efficiency due to their high ability to absorb water without dissolving, which increases the adsorbents&#x02019; surface area for different adsorption mechanisms [<xref rid="B11-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] like chemisorption, ion exchange, electrostatic, complexation, and hydrogen bonding interactions between adsorbents and targeted dyes. Hydrogel based on grafted polysaccharides such as gum, starch, and cellulose with polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid is highly in demand for dye wastewater treatments due to being low-cost, eco-friendly, reusable, biodegradable, and easy to operate [<xref rid="B15-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, traditional uncrosslinked graft copolymerization suffering from solubility or poor three-dimensional (3D) structure which decreases its capacitance for dye adsorption (for example, Sharma et al. [<xref rid="B18-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]) prepared cellulose grafted with 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid which showed maximum adsorption capacity (Q<sub>max</sub>) towards congo red (CR), crystal violet (CV), and malachite green (MG) dyes were 21, 53.5, and 46 mg g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Numerous efforts have been made to enhance adsorption capacity of hydrogel based on graft copolymers by using crosslinking agents [<xref rid="B19-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or adding nonmetals as a filler for better 3D structure and swelling ability [<xref rid="B21-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, these additives may affect the performance of the prepared graft copolymer; for example, Dai et al. [<xref rid="B23-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] prepared hydrogel by graft copolymerization of acrylamide and acrylic acid onto carboxymethyl cellulose with an incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) as a filler. Results showed that with increasing GO content from 20 mg to 80 mg, the adsorption enhanced from 80 mg/g to 130 mg/g towards MB on the other side the swelling ability decreased from 75 g/g to 55 g/g. It was also found that the additional GO could decrease the size of pores inside the hydroel matrix which inhibit water swelling.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are few research reports of hydrogel based on graft copolymers with Q<sub>max</sub> near to 2000 mg/g for MB dye within a very long equilibrium adsorption time, which ranges from many hours to days [<xref rid="B24-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. On the one hand, water in oil emulsion refers to a phenomenon that occurs when water droplets dispersed in oil dissolved materials (the continuous phase) by using a suitable stabilizing agent [<xref rid="B26-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], then the system undergoes phase inversion in a coagulation bath to leech out the droplets and precipitate the porous film. The previous method is extensively used in the fabrication of porous dialysis membranes for water purification, pharmaceutical products (e.g., scaffolds for drug delivery), and detergents [<xref rid="B27-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. On the other hand, emulsification inversion occurs when the dispersed phase inversed to the continuous phase or the revere [<xref rid="B26-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and this could be driven by controlling many factors such as shear rate, viscosity, and temperature. This method is highly recommended for preparing hierarchically porous materials having different pores size [<xref rid="B30-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. According to the literature review, no one has used this method for the preparation of hydrogel based on graft copolymer, and used it for MB dye adsorption. For a preliminary comparison, AG-g-PAM/PAA underwent conventional crosslinking using ECH in an alkaline environment. Both systems were used for adsorption of MB (200 mg/g) from an aqueous solution. The results revealed an ability of the novel porous hydrogel to adsorb 99% of MB dye in only 10 min however the conventional crosslinked graft copolymer didn&#x02019;t show significant MB dye adsorption after 10 min.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-polymers-12-00338"><title>2.

Arabic gum (0.5 g) was dissolved in 5 mL of distilled water under stirring. After the gum was completely dissolved, a freshly prepared solution of CAN (0.023 mol/L) in nitric acid (0.116 mol/L) was loaded into the gum solution. Finally, AM (5.3 mol/L) was directly added under stirring. Graft copolymerization experiment was conducted in a closed Pyrex cell which was put between a pair of tube fluorescent lamps (40 W) for 1.5 h. Graft polymerization experiment was terminated by adding acetone to the reaction mixture until complete precipitation. The crude product was dried in an oven at 40 &#x000b0;C until a constant weight was achieved. To remove the homopolymer (polyacrylamide), the crude copolymer was washed several times using 30% v/v (methanol/water). Finally, pure graft copolymer was dried to a constant weight in an oven under 40 &#x000b0;C to achieve grafting percentage (GP) 274%. The grafting percentage GP% was evaluated by the following equation; GP% = (A &#x02212; B) &#x000d7; 100/(B); where A and B are the weights of pure graft and Arabic gum, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot2-polymers-12-00338"><title>2.2.2.

Preparation of the Super-Adsorbent AG-g-PAM/PAA Hydrogel</title><p>Inverse emulsion technique was performed as follows: in a 250-mL beaker equipped with an overhead stirrer (RZR 2102, Heidolph Instruments, Schwabach, Germany) 80 mL of paraffin oil (continuous phase) was added under stirring at 600 rpm. The aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of AG-g-PAM/PAA (S4) in 20 mL of distilled water at pH = 9 at 600 rpm until completely dissolved. Before loading into the reactor, the aqueous solution was pre-emulsified by adding (2.5% w/v) of Triton X-100 as a nonionic stabilizing agent at 1300 rpm for 10 min to ensure the adsorption of surfactant on the surface of water droplets. The mixing rate was decreased to 400 rpm on the addition of 3.5 mL of ECH dropwise up to the reaction vessel using a syringe at a rate of 3.5 mL/h. After complete addition of ECH, the reaction speed increase to 2500 rpm to subject the emulsion inversion from W/O to O/W which was monitored by viscosity increment of the reaction to form a very viscous semi-solid mixture starting after 2 h of stirring. The reaction speed was decreased after that to 600 rpm and left for an additional 4 h to assure complete inversion. Finally, the mixture was subjected to precipitation in acetone as a non-solvent for the graft copolymer and to leech out the oil droplet inside the graft matrix. The highly porous graft product was then dried in an oven under 40 &#x000b0;C until constant weight. For preliminary comparison, AG-g-PAM/PAA was undergoing to conventional crosslinking with ECH using the same previous reaction condition without using paraffin oil and Triton X-100.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-polymers-12-00338"><title>2.3.

The more intense peak at 1077 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> represents more ether linkage (C&#x02013;O&#x02013;C), which was introduced by the crosslinking reaction [<xref rid="B33-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>To confirm the formation of hydrogel pore structure, SEM images of AG-g-PAM and the AG-g-PAM/PAA hydrogel with different preparation methods are shown in <xref rid="polymers-12-00338-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> where it can be seen that the surface of AG-g-PAM/PAA crosslinked hydrogel prepared with conventional method appeared smooth, and with no observable porosity, while the porous crosslinked hydrogel prepared in emulsion showed high pore density with macropores. The pores have a regular spherical shape and irregular shapes. The reason explains that the variety of pore size and shapes comes from the fact that during the emulsification inversion process and because of the high shear rate of mixing, the coalescence of the oil droplets could be initiated, which produces different droplet sizes and shapes (<xref rid="polymers-12-00338-sch003" ref-type="fig">Scheme 3</xref>) [<xref rid="B26-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The average porosity of the dried hydrogel was calculated to be 78% [<xref rid="B24-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The high porous density with macro and micro sizes could facilitate the fast and easy penetration of dyes and water inside the hydrogel matrix, which explains the high SR of the novel porous hydrogel [<xref rid="B24-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The water absorption and water retention capacities of the AG-g-PAM/PAA hydrogel have a great role in the adsorption of MB dyes [<xref rid="B20-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B24-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The additional swelling can increase the surface area, allowing more sites to be completely exposed to MB dyes. In our novel porous hydrogel, the 3d porous structure allows water solvent to flow simultaneously by convection and diffusion, whereas the size of the pores gradually increased, channels became wide, and the pore walls became thinner [<xref rid="B35-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

In contrast, the nonporous hydrogel prepared by conventional method showed gradual water absorption with increasing time to reach approximately 45 times after 120 min.

In the first 4 h, the curve shows a sharp decrease, but after that, the water retention proceeds slowly. This is due to, initially, the big voids contained in the gel having a weak water connection and being easily disconnected. With the passing of the time, more small pores beside the substantial hydroxyl, amide, and carboxylate groups in the hydrogel made the interaction stronger, which enhanced the water retention, leading to a relatively slow dehydration [<xref rid="B24-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B37-polymers-12-00338" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Conclusions</title><p>In summary, AG-g-PAM was prepared by free radical graft copolymerization of acrylamide onto Arabic gum. The graft product then underwent partial alkaline hydrolysis to have carboxylic groups. The water in oil emulsion inversion to oil in water for AG-g-PAM/PAA was used for creating high pore density during crosslinking reaction. The macropores channels created within the matrix structure of the novel porous hydrogel showed fast water swelling to reach 200 times its original weight after 10 min. The adsorption of MB dye onto the superadsorpent hydrogel perfectly fits the Langmuir adsorption model and pseudo-second-order models. The maximum adsorption capacity was 2300 mg/g at pH = 7 and this is the first time that PAM/PAA-based AG hydrogel adsorbent to achieve maximum adsorption capacity of more than 2000 mg/g for MB dye removal. On the other hand, the water-swollen hydrogel could retain 80% and 40% of its weight after 24 h at 45 and 60 &#x000b0;C, respectively, which can open a new window for release-control studies in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Researchers supporting project number (RSP-2019/63) financially supported by King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-polymers-12-00338"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/12/2/338/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/12/2/338/s1</uri>, Figure S1: Influence of pH on adsorption of MB onto AG-g-PAM/PAA porous hydrogel.
