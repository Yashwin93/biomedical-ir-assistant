However, long-read applications are still constrained by their high sequencing error rates and low sequencing throughput. Here, we present NanoVar, an optimized structural variant caller utilizing low-depth (8X) whole-genome sequencing data generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. NanoVar exhibits higher structural variant calling accuracy when benchmarked against current tools using low-depth simulated datasets. In patient samples, we successfully validate structural variants characterized by NanoVar and uncover normal alternative sequences or alleles which are present in healthy individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Structural variants</kwd><kwd>SV characterization</kwd><kwd>Long reads</kwd><kwd>Oxford Nanopore sequencing</kwd><kwd>Third-generation sequencing</kwd><kwd>WGS</kwd><kwd>Low depth</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Singapore Ministry of Education's AcRF </institution></funding-source><award-id>MOE2014-T3-1-006</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ID: 231753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benoukraf</surname><given-names>Touati</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">Structural variations are implicated in the development of many human diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and account for most of the genetic variations by means of nucleotides in the human population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Structural variants (SVs), defined as genomic alterations greater than 50 base pairs (bp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], can functionally affect cellular physiology by forming genetic lesions which may lead to gene dysregulation or novel gene fusions, driving the development of diseases such as cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], Mendelian disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and complex diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. SVs can exist as different classes including deletion, duplication, insertion, inversion, and translocation. Over the years, disease-associated SVs were indicated as biomarkers for diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and therapy guidance for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which could be screened through sequencing-based and non-sequencing-based methods in clinics. As the clinical impacts of SVs continue to unveil, there is a clear need for accurate, rapid, and inexpensive workflows for routine SV profiling in patients to expedite biomarker discovery and broaden clinical investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">There are currently two main standards of sequencing-based methods for comprehensive SV detection: long-read or third-generation sequencing (3GS) and short-read or second-generation sequencing (2GS). Although 3GS technologies were made accessible to a large audience, it has not yet supplanted 2GS technologies due to its higher sequencing error rate and lower throughput [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. While 3GS is currently mainly restricted to the study of small genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] or targeted sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], recent studies have reported mammalian whole-genome sequencing (WGS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] but at a higher sequencing cost per megabase as compared to the older technologies. In the domain of SV discovery, many groups have reported that 3GS approaches provided higher SV detection sensitivity and resolution than 2GS, despite their higher sequencing error rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This is mostly due to the inadequacy of short reads (50&#x02013;200&#x02009;bp) to elucidate large genomic variations also involving novel sequence insertions or repetitive elements, which may give rise to high false discovery rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. On the other hand, longer read lengths (&#x0003e;&#x02009;1&#x02009;kb) reduce mapping ambiguity, resolve repetitive sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and complex SVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and discover a much larger extent of SVs than short reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Despite better SV detection capabilities, the low throughput and high sequencing cost per megabase of 3GS obstruct its feasibility to be used in routine SV interrogation in patients.</p><p id="Par4">To overcome these issues, we developed a new SV caller tool, NanoVar, which utilizes low-depth Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) WGS data for accurate SV characterization in patients. NanoVar adopts a neural-network-based algorithm for high-confident SV detection and SV zygosity estimation for all SV classes. It is optimized to work with shallow long-read WGS data at a minimum sequencing depth of 4X (12 gigabases (Gb)) for homozygous SVs and 8X (24 Gb) for heterozygous SVs, which can be achieved with one to ten ONT MinION sequencing runs, depending on the flowcell chemistry, library preparation kit, and sample quality. In this manuscript, we evaluated NanoVar&#x02019;s SV detection precision and recall among other tools using simulation datasets and real data. When applied to patient data, we demonstrated the feasibility and speed of implementing the NanoVar workflow for SV discovery in low-depth 3GS clinical samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The NanoVar workflow</title><p id="Par5">The NanoVar workflow is a series of processes that utilizes 3GS long reads to discover and characterize SVs in DNA samples. The sequencing of the genome of interest is carried out by ONT MinION to produce long reads reported in FASTQ/FASTA formats (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The sequencing output of several sequencing runs can be combined to achieve enough depth of coverage for SV discovery. Based on our initial tests performed in simulated datasets (cf. hereafter), we recommend having at least 12&#x02013;24&#x02009;Gb of sequencing data (covering approximately 4&#x02013;8X of the human genome), which can be achieved through one to ten MinION runs depending on the flowcell chemistry (R9.4, R9.5), library preparation kit (1D, 1D<sup>2</sup>, 2D), and DNA sample quality (purity, quantity, and fragment length). The R9.4 flowcell chemistry with a 1D sequencing library using high purity DNA with a mean fragment length of 8&#x02009;kb provides the highest throughput per MinION flowcell (above 12&#x02009;Gb). The combined FASTQ/FASTA file is used as input into the NanoVar tool for SV processing. NanoVar begins by mapping the long reads against a reference genome using HS-BLASTN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to obtain the alignment profile of each read (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Reads with incomplete alignments (containing divergent sequence/gap) are selected and evaluated through an SV characterization algorithm (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1) to characterize for the possible SV classes. NanoVar can distinguish six classes of SV: deletion (DEL), inversion (INV), tandem duplication (DUP), insertion (INS, novel sequence insertion/insertion of sequences absent from reference genome), transposition (insertion of sequences found elsewhere in the reference genome), and translocation. Due to the close resemblance in altered sequences between a transposition and a translocation, they are collectively labeled as &#x0201c;breakends&#x0201d; (BND) but are still dissociable by the &#x0201c;SV2&#x0201d; field in the &#x0201c;INFO&#x0201d; column of the variant calling format (VCF) file. After all reads are classified, NanoVar calculates the read-depth coverages for all the SV breakend sites, separating the number of breakend-supporting reads and breakend-opposing reads. Lastly, the read-depth coverage of each SV, together with other SV characteristics, are used as features for a simulation-trained neural network classifier to determine a confidence score for each SV. This confidence score is used to rank the SVs by confidence and reduces false positives in the final output. The filtered list of SVs is recorded in a VCF file and an HTML report. The HTML report provides an overview of the SV analysis and an SV output table containing the information of each SV which can be filtered and downloaded in MS Excel or CSV formats. The figures presented in the report also include an SV class distribution chart and read length distribution of the sequencing reads which serves to QC for the input (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). NanoVar also assigns a breakend read ratio value to each SV to estimate their SV zygosity, where a ratio of 1.0 refers to a homozygous estimation and 0.5 refers to a heterozygous estimation.

Each dataset contains 42,000 SVs of the various SV classes with sizes estimated from real data (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2a). Most of the SV breakends (&#x0003e;&#x02009;75%) are positioned within repetitive sequence regions demarcated by UCSC Browser&#x02019;s RepeatMasker track. Sequencing reads of both long-read and short-read sequencing were simulated to a sequencing depth of 4&#x02013;12X and 53X respectively and were used as input for the workflows of each tool. Sniffles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], SVIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], Picky [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and NanoSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] are 3GS long-read SV callers while novoBreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and Delly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] are 2GS short-read SV callers. To evaluate predicted SVs fairly, we segregated each ground-truth SV into its breakend coordinates and allow a 400-bp error distance around it to create an 800-bp window. Each DEL, INV, and DUP SV possesses two breakends, while each INS and BND SV possesses one breakend. SVs predicted by each tool were also segregated to SV breakends and intersected with the ground-truth breakend regions. A hit will be considered if a predicted SV breakend falls within any ground-truth breakend region. We first performed a global SV breakend evaluation where SV class prediction was omitted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). At a sequencing depth of 4X, NanoVar outperformed the other 3GS tools in precision and recall for homozygous and heterozygous SVs, achieving the highest <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> scores of 0.95 and 0.85 respectively. Sniffles and SVIM followed close behind with <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> scores of 0.86 and 0.75 for homozygous SVs and 0.70 and 0.66 for heterozygous SVs. For both SV zygosities, NanoSV achieved the highest precision of more than 0.99 among all tools, but it displayed low detection sensitivities (0.31, 0.16) which brought its <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> scores down to 0.48 and 0.27. Conversely, Picky performed slightly better in recall (0.58, 0.38) but exhibited low precision (0.02, 0.02). While NanoVar, Sniffles, and SVIM coped reasonably well with 4X sequencing data, such sequencing depth might not be appropriate for NanoSV and Picky. To find out if a higher sequencing depth might improve performance, we tested the 3GS tools at sequencing depths of 8X and 12X for heterozygous SVs and observed a comparable increase in recall for all tools (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Despite the increase in recall, <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> score improvement was only seen in NanoVar and NanoSV as the other tools had a decrease in precision as coverage increases. The performance of NanoSV might continue to improve with an increasing depth of coverage as it was previously observed to perform better with high coverage (79X) ONT real dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Similar to 4X depth, NanoVar exhibited the highest <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> scores of 0.92 and 0.95 at 8X and 12X depths respectively. In general, when compared to 2GS SV callers such as Delly and novoBreak, 3GS SV callers recalled more SVs for both zygosity states, despite using considerably lower depth of sequencing data.

A hit is only considered when a predicted SV breakend falls into a ground-truth breakend region that belongs to the same SV class as the predicted. NanoVar portrayed relatively well-rounded accuracies for all the SV classes for homozygous SVs (DUP 0.85, DEL 0.96, INS 0.80, BND 0.88, INV 0.66) and heterozygous SVs (DUP 0.81, DEL 0.83, INS 0.67, BND 0.73, INV 0.70), exhibiting the best accuracies for DUP and INS among all tools. Sniffles and SVIM also performed moderately well, with their highest <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> scores pertaining to homozygous DEL (0.91, 0.75) and lowest <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> scores pertaining to heterozygous INS (0.40, 0.35). The low DEL and INS accuracies observed in Picky were attributed to its high false-positive rates when calling for these two classes (precision &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.03), suggesting an explanation for its poor overall performance in the first evaluation. Despite that, Picky performed considerably well for DUP, INV, and BND SVs. NanoSV&#x02019;s limited performance was due to its inability to characterize INV SVs completely and its low SV recall which was prominently observed in DEL and INS, despite its capability of being highly precise. Both 2GS SV callers performed acceptably well especially for INV SVs, which excelled over all other tools. However, they were inadequate in characterizing INS SVs when compared to most 3GS SV callers.</p><p id="Par8">As SV formation is known to be associated with repeat regions in the human genome, we investigated the effects of repetitive sequences on SV recall by all tools within our simulations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e, f, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3). We intersected all ground-truth SV regions with the RepeatMasker track from UCSC&#x02019;s Browser to identify their overlaps with the different repetitive sequence families such as short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE) and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE). In our dataset, most of the ground-truth SVs overlapped with SINE and LINE regions, while less were scattered among DNA transposons, long terminal repeats (LTR), low complexity, satellite, and simple repeat regions. For all tools, SV recall was observed to be fairly consistent across the different repeat families, suggesting that neither of the tools was greatly vulnerable to any specific type of repetitive sequence. As expected with regard to the previous SV breakend evaluations, NanoVar displayed the greatest recall of SVs across all kinds of repeats for both zygosity states. Taken together, our simulation results demonstrated NanoVar&#x02019;s higher SV characterization sensitivity and precision among other long-read 3GS SV callers at a sequencing depth of 4&#x02013;12X.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Benchmarking NanoVar using real data</title><p id="Par9">As simulated data may not capture all aspects of reality, we also carried out benchmarking using real PacBio sequencing data for the Coriell DNA sample NA12878 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

For deletions, SVIM performed the best recall (0.79) at 4X depth, followed by NanoVar (0.71), Sniffles (0.58), and Picky (0.54). All the tools improved considerably at 8X depth but the same trend was observed. For insertions at 4X depth, NanoVar had the greatest recall (0.66), followed by SVIM (0.62), Sniffles (0.28), and Picky (0.22). At 8X depth, NanoVar and SVIM were tied for recall (0.82), while improvement was also seen in other tools. Similar to our simulations, NanoSV performed poorly in recall for both SV classes at both depths. Overall, NanoVar was observed to perform comparably well with SVIM on recalling deletions and insertions from real PacBio sequencing data. As the SVs in this benchmark set is non-exhaustive and could not be considered as the ground truth, the evaluation is incomprehensive and NanoVar would still require further testing on real experimentally validated SVs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Precise SV characterization in AML patients using NanoVar</title><p id="Par10">We tested the NanoVar workflow on two Asian patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (patient 1 and patient 2) to evaluate the workflow&#x02019;s feasibility and SV characterization accuracy in low sequencing depth clinical samples. Genomic DNA extracted from bone marrow mononuclear cells of each patient was sequenced by nanopore sequencing using two to five MinION flowcells, generating about 12.4&#x02009;Gb and 12.3&#x02009;Gb of sequencing data respectively (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). The sequencing reads were applied to NanoVar for read mapping and SV characterization with a minimum support of two reads for each breakend to increase stringency for clinical data. NanoVar discovered a total of 14,215 SVs (3218 DUP, 6706 DEL, 2626 INS, 1348 BND, 317 INV) in patient 1 and 16,562 SVs (3019 DUP, 8727 DEL, 2576 INS, 1976 BND, 264 INV) in patient 2 (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5). To evaluate NanoVar&#x02019;s accuracy in these samples, we surveyed eight SVs from each patient for PCR validation. We selected SVs with a range of confidence scores and breakend read ratios which approximate SV zygosity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). All the selected SVs are situated in autosomal chromosomes (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). Primer sequences were designed flanking the breakend location(s) of each SV according to the reference genome, and their referenced amplicon lengths (in silico PCR length without the SV) are recorded in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, along with their breakend read ratios and estimated SV sizes. PCR performed for each SV in their respective patient samples revealed that all 16 SVs were validated to be true based on their product size deviation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c lanes 1 and 8, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5a). Moreover, the PCR results were agreeable with the SV class, SV size, and SV zygosities estimated by NanoVar, based on the number of PCR products (one product for homozygous, two products for heterozygous). All amplified products were gel extracted and their sequence identity validated by Sanger sequencing (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Besides PCR validation, all 16 SVs were also found to be supported by mapped 2GS short reads generated by Illumina WGS (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S6).

Patient 1 was discovered to possess all eight SVs that were validated in patient 2, while patient 2 possesses six of the eight SVs validated in patient 1. In total, 14 out of 16 validated SVs were discovered to be shared between patient 1 and patient 2, leaving SVs 1-5 and 1-8 to be patient 1 specific (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5). Next, we investigated if NanoVar was sensitive enough to capture these shared SVs in the respective patient. In patient 1, NanoVar was able to detect five out of eight shared SVs, while in patient 2, all six shared SVs were detected, aggregating to 11 out of 14 shared SVs recalled (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5). We investigated the three undetected heterozygous shared SVs (SVs 2-2, 2-3, and 2-8) and discovered that they had insufficient or an absence of SV-associated reads at their loci, while still having reads originating from the &#x0201c;wild-type&#x0201d; allele. These results suggest that a higher depth of coverage (&#x0003e;&#x02009;4X) would be required by NanoVar to confidently and broadly capture heterozygous SVs as observed in the simulated benchmarking.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>NanoVar characterizes polymorphic SVs</title><p id="Par12">Upon assessing the presence of these SVs across more samples, we observed that most SVs appeared to be polymorphic. We tested the SVs in several samples consisting of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from two non-AML Asian individuals (normal A and normal B), an epithelial colorectal carcinoma cell line (HCT116) and a Caucasian non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line (MCF10A). We found out that normal HSC samples do possess many of the SVs (13 out of the 16 SVs) which existed in at least one allele in either one or both HSC samples, while SVs 1-5, 1-8, and 2-4 were absent in both HSC samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c lanes 3, 4, 9, and 10). Interestingly, these 13 shared SVs were also present in both patient 1 and patient 2, suggesting that these SVs might be prevalently found in cells, irrespective of AML disease. On the contrary, SVs absent in the HSC samples (SVs 1-5 and 1-8) were exclusively found in patient 1, except for SV 2-4, which was found in both patient samples. Out of these 13 shared SVs, 11 of them were also present in non-hematopoietic cell lines such as HCT116 and MCF10A (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12), leaving two SVs (SVs 2-7 and 2-8) undetected in either cell lines. Taken together, the majority of the SVs (11 out of 16 SVs) were commonly found across the samples regardless of AML disease status, cell type, and ethnicity. Moreover, most SVs exhibited different zygosities among the samples (all SVs excluding SV 1-1, 1-2, 1-8, and 2-5), which suggest a polymorphic nature. Within the scope of this study, we categorized the SVs into three groups based on their prevalence and zygosity variation across the samples: (1) rare sample-specific SVs (SV 1-8), (2) common SVs with no zygosity variation which might be due to an incorrect reference genome (SVs 1-1, 1-2, and 2-5), and (3) common SVs with zygosity variation or polymorphic SVs (remaining SVs) which constituted most of the SVs characterized by NanoVar.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>The NanoVar workflow is time efficient</title><p id="Par13">We compared the CPU time and maximum resident set size (memory) used by the workflows of each tool for SV characterization in patient 1 to evaluate their processing speed and memory usage (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S6). Among 3GS SV callers, NanoVar stood out as the most time-efficient tool by requiring about tenfold lesser CPU hours than the rest to process 12&#x000a0;Gb of sequencing data using 24 threads. In real time, NanoVar took 196&#x02009;min for the entire analysis of patient 1 which is the fastest among all other tools.

NanoVar&#x02019;s performance was reflected in low-depth real data such as sample NA12878 and clinical data where we successfully validated a small subset of SVs discovered by NanoVar (16/16) and demonstrated reliable estimations of SV class, size, and zygosity. Results from both simulated and real data also suggested that 4X sequencing depth may be suboptimal for comprehensive heterozygous SV discovery and would recommend a higher sequencing depth of 8X.</p><p id="Par15">Although we propose the confidence score of 1.0 as a default threshold for running NanoVar, there might be situations where it is less effective and requires the re-training of the neural network model. The threshold score was observed as the optimal score for the balance of both precision and recall in simulated experiments. Thus, the effectiveness of the threshold is dependent on the resemblance of data characteristics between simulated and real environments, which may be quite different in certain situations. Such cases may include the usage of long reads from new sequencing technologies utterly different from ONT or PacBio, or analyzing genomes with vastly more proportion of repetitive sequences than the human genome. In these situations, the alignment profile of each read (e.g., mismatch errors, number of multi-maps) might be exclusive and thus requires re-training for a better fit using the tutorial provided on GitHub (see the &#x0201c;Availability of data and materials&#x0201d; section).</p><p id="Par16">One major advantage of 3GS over 2GS SV calling approaches is the amount of raw sequencing data consumed. In our study, we showed that 12&#x000a0;Gb of 3GS data (4X coverage) produced a more comprehensive SV detection outcome than 160&#x000a0;Gb of 2GS data (53X coverage) when comparing the analysis done by NanoVar and 2GS SV callers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). The considerable reduction in sequencing data requirements could speed up SV analysis and reduce computational resources. 3GS approaches may be used in large-scale SV-association studies or routine sequencing-based clinical investigations to analyze and store massive amounts of sequencing FASTQ/FASTA files more efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Despite NanoVar&#x02019;s high accuracy, many of its characterized SVs might be SV polymorphisms commonly found in the human population.

As SV polymorphisms are widespread in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], it is important to annotate these SVs by cross-referencing to collective polymorphic-SV databases to facilitate the discovery of disease-associated SVs.

The entire training dataset consists of 933,351 true and 41,186 false examples of novel adjacencies. Another simulated dataset (4X) with a different SV profile was used as the test dataset.

The R Bioconductor package, RSVSim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], was used to introduce novel adjacencies systematically in a reference genome to create different classes of SV. One SV simulation dataset consists of two genomes where one has 32,000 SVs of deletions (20,000), balanced inversions (1000), single tandem duplications (1000), and genomic sequence transpositions (10,000), and the other has 10,000 SVs containing only viral insertions which mimics novel insertions. The amounts for each SV were based approximately on SV occurrence reported by Chaisson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. SV lengths were estimated by the <italic>estimateSVSizes()</italic> function in RSVSim, which takes reference from the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV) (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2a).

The virus selection was based on their ability to integrate into the host genome. To simulate SV sequence variability, each novel adjacency has a 20-bp flanking region where bases had a 25% chance of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and a 50% chance of introducing indels with a maximum indel length of 5&#x02009;bp.

The combination of all the reads produced the simulation of homozygous SV (50%), heterozygous SV (33%), and low-confidence SV (17%). A homozygous SV only has breakend-supporting reads at their breakends while a heterozygous SV has both breakend-supporting and breakend-opposing reads at similar proportions.
