The title for empty reviews can state that there is no evidence, for example, &#x0201c;there is no rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of refugee resettlement programs&#x0201d;. Titles can also reflect the size of the effects or the quality of the evidence, for example, &#x0201c;Limited evidence and limited effects of advocacy to reduce intimate partner violence&#x0201d;.</p><sec id="cl21118-sec-0020"><label>1.1</label><title>The review in brief</title><p>A short summary of the main findings of the review. This section may be no more than one sentence, and should not exceed 50 words. For example, &#x0201c;custodial sentences are no better than non&#x02010;custodial sentences in reducing re&#x02010;offending&#x0201d;.</p><p>Selective outcome reporting is to be avoided. So reviews with several primary outcomes will require a longer review in brief section, for example, &#x0201c;Intensive advocacy may improve everyday life for women in domestic violence shelters/refuges and reduce physical abuse. There is no clear evidence that intensive advocacy reduces sexual, emotional, or overall abuse, or that it benefits women's mental health. It is unclear whether brief advocacy is effective&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="cl21118-sec-0030"><label>1.2</label><title>What is this review about?</title><p>This section should include:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A &#x0201c;problem statement&#x0201d; of the issue being addressed. For example, &#x0201c;half of all crime takes place in small, localised areas, or hot spots&#x0201d;; and &#x0201c;forests are an important resource for managing climate change because they store carbon, which helps mitigates the effect of carbon emissions. However, the amount of forest cover, particularly in low&#x02010; and middle&#x02010;income countries (LMICs), is declining. Deforestation is responsible for 10&#x02013;17% of global carbon emissions&#x0201d;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A clear description of the intervention being assessed. For example, &#x0201c;Payment for environmental services are voluntary contracts to supply a well&#x02010;defined environmental service in exchange for payment. For the purposes of this review, the service must involve the maintenance or rehabilitation of natural forests&#x0201d;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The outcomes included in the review. For example &#x0201c;this review looked at whether custodial and alternative noncustodial sanctions have different effects on the rates of re&#x02010;offending&#x0201d;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Optional: the policy question being addressed. For example, &#x0201c;the review considers evidence regarding the debate about whether PESs should also aim to reduce poverty, or whether doing so would undermine conservation efforts&#x0201d;.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="cl21118-sec-0040"><label>1.3</label><title>What is the aim of this review?</title><p>People do not always understand that the results of a plain language summary come from a systematic review rather than a single study. Some also wrongly assume that the review authors have carried out the studies themselves. A text box should be included on the first page stating what the review studied, and how many studies were included.</p><p>For example: This Campbell systematic review examines the effects custodial sentences on reoffending, compared to the effects of noncustodial sentences. The review summarises evidence from fourteen high&#x02010;quality studies, including three randomised controlled trials and two natural experiments.</p></sec><sec id="cl21118-sec-0050"><label>1.4</label><title>What are the main findings of this review?</title><sec id="cl21118-sec-0060"><label>1.4.1</label><title>First subheading: &#x0201c;What studies are included?&#x0201d;</title><p>A brief description of the number of included studies and key characteristics (e.g., study design and region or country). For example, &#x0201c;this review includes studies that evaluate the effects of custodial and non&#x02010;custodial sanctions on reoffending. A total of 38 studies were identified. However, only 14 of these were assessed to be of sufficient methodological quality to be included in the final analysis. The studies spanned the period from 1961 to 2013 and were mostly carried out in the USA, Europe and Australia&#x0201d;.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Optional</italic>: add a statement about the quality of the evidence. For example, &#x0201c;the studies all had some important methodological weaknesses. None of the included studies used experimental designs (random assignment)&#x0201d;.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Additional subheadings</italic> state the question being answered in that section, for example, &#x0201c;Does focusing crime prevention efforts on crime hot spots reduce crime?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;What factors affect how well PES programmes work?&#x0201d;</p><p>These sub&#x02010;sections give a short summary of the review evidence to answer that question. Present the results consistently, using similar words and expressions for similar levels of effect (see Appendix 1 for suggested wordings). Ensure that the results are reported consistently between the plain language summary and the main text of the review, including the abstract, results and summary of main results. For example, &#x0201c;Yes. There is an overall reduction in crime and disorder when hot spots policing interventions are implemented. The largest reductions are in drug offences, violent crime and disorder offences, with smaller reductions in property crime&#x0201d;.</p><p>

The results for each main outcome must be presented in the section called &#x0201c;What are the main findings?&#x0201d; (or a variation specific to the review such as &#x0201c;Does focusing crime prevention efforts on crime hot spots reduce crime?&#x0201d;). If you found no data on an important outcome, you must present the outcome anyway, but explain that no data were found.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Using qualitative statements when presenting the effects of the intervention: You may be able to increase the accessibility of the review by avoiding numbers and using qualitative statements to present the results. By &#x0201c;qualitative statements&#x0201d; we mean an expression of your results in plain language, using similar words and expressions for similar levels of effect. Qualitative statements about effect are difficult to get right. It is easy to cause confusion and misinterpretation by using words inconsistently or statements such as &#x0201c;a high likelihood of somewhat small but possibly important effects&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="cl21118-sec-0070"><label>1.4.2</label><title>Optional subheading: How has this intervention worked?</title><p>Present here the evidence relating to the main assumptions and links in the theory of change for the intervention(s) being assessed.

Those people who are currently experiencing homelessness have a much greater risk of poorer physical and mental health than the general population (Homeless Link), and so the requirement to access health and social care (HSC) services is increased.</p><p>Homelessness affects individuals who are experiencing life without safe, adequate, or stable housing. Conceived in this way, homelessness not only describes those individuals who are visibly homeless and living on the street, but also those precariously housed individuals who; stay in emergency accommodation, sleep in crowded or inadequate housing, and those who are not safe in their living environment. FEANTSA further classify individuals experiencing homelessness as those who are roofless, those who are houseless and those who experience insecure or inadequate housing (Feantsa,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Accessing HSC services while homeless is problematic for several reasons. First, there are many countries in the world without a free health care system and individuals experiencing homelessness may need to prioritise food and temporary shelter over their basic HSC needs (Hoshide, Manog, Noh, &#x00026; Omori,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Second, there can be difficulties associated with registering for HSC services due to practical issues such as the requirement of documentation including; health insurance, personal identification, national insurance/social security numbers, or current address details (Feldman et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Third, issues with the location of the HSC services may be an additional barrier to those without access to transport (Syed, Gerber, &#x00026; Sharp,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Fourth, it may be that there is a lack of suitable HSC services to meet an individual's needs, or there may be a waiting list that delays a person's access to the service they require (Hudson et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Fifth, the individual may be someone who has multiple HSC needs. The range and complexity of these needs, along with the potentially chaotic nature of the individual's life as a result may make it particularly difficult for the person experiencing homelessness to access all the services that they require without HSC support (Moore, Manias, &#x00026; Gerdtz Marie,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This is due to the fact that meeting these needs may entail managing a range of professional appointments in a variety of different HSC settings. Sixth, people experiencing homelessness, who may be dealing with one or more HSC needs, may live in, or be placed in living environments, for example, hostel accommodation, which may not be suitable to their recovery pathways. The increased stress that these living arrangements may cause may reduce the individual's HSC outcomes, for example, a person with an underlying mental health issue may experience increased anxiety and/or depression. A person with an addiction issue may also relapse into alcohol or drug addiction due to this increased environmental stress coupled with the decreased difficulty in procuring the substances that they may have an issue with. An exacerbation of one or both of these HSC needs may lead to a decreased capacity on the part of the person who is experiencing homelessness to access relevant HSC services or remain compliant with HSC services that they were engaging with (Padgett, Tiderington, Tran Smith, Derejko, &#x00026; Henwood,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Finally, people experiencing homelessness will experience high levels of prejudice and discrimination (Weng &#x00026; Clark,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0059" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and so fear of these pervasive attitudes and behaviours, coupled with low confidence and self&#x02010;esteem, may inhibit access to HSC services for those who require them most.</p><p>Previous research has demonstrated that gender may play an important role in HSC needs and how services are used. For example, males were more likely to report substance abuse (Berdahl, Hoyt, &#x00026; Whitbeck,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), females were more likely to have suffered sexual harassment and assault (Ensign &#x00026; Panke,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), and are much more likely to seek out and use health care services (Ensign,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Piliavin, Westerfelt, Wong, &#x00026; Afflerbach,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cl21118-sec-0120"><label>2.2</label><title>The intervention</title><p>Individuals experiencing homelessness often have various comorbidities requiring support from a range of HSC services. These services may be provided by professionals such as general practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, community nurses, psychotherapists, occupational therapists, hospital staff, dentists, pharmacists, and staff working in housing, employment or education services. As outlined previously, a person experiencing homelessness may face seemingly impenetrable barriers to accessing these services and professionals.</p><p>To improve access to HSC services, interventions must address the barriers which exist. This systematic review will include all relevant studies which assess the effectiveness of interventions which aim to improve the accessibility of HSC services for individuals experiencing, or at risk of experiencing homelessness. Here we will focus on interventions which change something about how, where, or to whom the service is delivered or where the services actively seek to remove barriers to access for this population. Although related, this systematic review is not concerned with those studies which assess the effectiveness of the HSC services themselves. We will only include interventions that seek to change something about the service, and how it is delivered, to increase its accessibility. We will exclude interventions that only seek to change the service users' behaviour or provide support for a person to access an existing service. Service level change must be a component of the intervention. For example, many case management programmes will assign a case manager to work with individuals to help them to navigate the complex landscape of services and entitlements in their local area. This approach does not typically involve the services themselves making changes to improve accessibility.</p></sec><sec id="cl21118-sec-0130"><label>2.3</label><title>How the intervention might work</title><p>McIntyre et al. (<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) have created a conceptual framework (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) to capture the precise meaning of access to health care in low&#x02010; and middle&#x02010;income countries. The three dimensions identified by the study authors are availability, affordability and acceptability. This research provides a framework for this review to both categorise the studies and understand the barriers and opportunities that may influence access to HSC services for individuals experiencing homelessness. These dimensions are described in more detail below.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="Figure" id="cl21118-fig-0001"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Access evaluation framework as presented in McIntyre&#x000a0;et al.

These interventions may address barriers such as:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The physical location of HSC services in relation to the service user (e.g., are clinics which deal with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] related illness situated in places where there is a high proportion of homeless individuals with HIV?).</p></list-item><list-item><p>System factors such as the opening hours of services and how appointment systems are managed (e.g., ensuring that service hours are also available outside working hours to allow employed individuals to avail of the services they require).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Relationship between what the service provider has to offer and what the service user requires (e.g., a service provider which seeks to provide care in a holistic way so that the service user is not required to wait for multiple referrals from various providers. One example might be the integration of an outpatient treatment centre within a primary care&#x000a0;setting).</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="cl21118-sec-0150"><label>2.3.2</label><title>Affordability</title><p>Interventions in this category are those which address the gap between the costs of the service against the person's ability to pay. Most interventions included in this category focus on the provision of public funding, vouchers, or charitable donations to enable a person to access the services they require. These interventions to address affordability of HSC services work to remove barriers associated with the following factors:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The price of the service at the point of delivery (e.g., a scheme which provides free medical care to the service user).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Direct costs (McIntyre et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) describe direct costs using examples such as transportation, special diets, child care (e.g., providing free insulin to individuals who are diabetic).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Indirect costs (McIntyre et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) describe indirect costs using examples such as lost income or productivity while travelling to and from, and waiting to be seen by, a health care provider. For example, if a person has a mental illness and is employed, they may be unable to access a service due to the time requirements. A relevant intervention may provide monetary cover for the loss of income while they avail of the necessary service.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="cl21118-sec-0160"><label>2.3.3</label><title>Acceptability</title><p>This category contains interventions which focus on preparedness of different HSC professional groupings, either individually or within multidisciplinary teams, to address the HSC needs of specific individuals. Different HSC professional groupings tend to have differing perspectives on the underlying causes of specific issues and how best to support these needs. This is based on the training that the individual professions receive and their professional socialisation. These differing perspectives can have a profound effect on the ability of people who are experiencing homelessness to access HSC services. HSC services which operate out of a psychosocial model are likely to promote access for people who are experiencing homelessness due to their person&#x02010; centred nature and wider assessment criteria. HSC services which would adhereadhering to the medical model would likely reduce access to services for people who are experiencing homelessness, unless their needs fit within its more stringent diagnostic criteria. Interventions here may focus primarily on the attitudes and expectations each group will have of the other, and how addressing these pervasive cognitive factors may improve access to services.</p><p>Some examples of these include:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Provider expectations (e.g., a provider may offer extended and additional services for those who adhere to the prescribed treatment).</p></list-item><list-item><p>User expectations (e.g., the desire to be listened to and respected when describing service needs. Perhaps enhancing autonomy of care by creating a comprehensive care plan between the service provider and user).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Improving cooperation between service providers to meet the service usersuser's expectations (e.g., minimising the burden placed on individuals experiencing homelessness, by creating a smoother referral process and improving communication between statutory, community and voluntary organisations offering HSC services).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Facilitating access to HSC services helps those individuals experiencing homelessness lead more independent, healthy and happy lives while retaining autonomy over their HSC choices. When a service that someone requires and is entitled to is inaccessible, they cannot receive the treatment and support available, meaning it has failed to meet their needs.</p><p>Considerations for improving access to HSC services include the physical environment of the service, staff levels of awareness, empathy and understanding, eligibility criteria for accessing the service and the physical location where the service is delivered.</p></sec></sec><sec id="cl21118-sec-0170"><label>2.4</label><title>Why it is important to do this review</title><p>The United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS) recognises the need to improve access to services especially to underprivileged groups as outlined in principle one of the NHS constitution.</p><p>&#x0201c;The NHS provides a comprehensive service, available to all&#x02026;it has a duty to each and every individual that it serves and must respect their human rights. At the same time, it has a wider social duty to promote equality through the services it provides and to pay particular attention to groups or sections of society where improvements in health and life expectancy are not keeping pace with the rest of the population&#x0201d;.</p><p>To ensure that policymakers and practitioners' avail of the most robust and rigorous evidence to date, there is a significant need to identify and combine all relevant interventions which aim to improve accessibility of HSC services for individuals experiencing, or at risk of experiencing homelessness. Through the proposed evidence synthesis, we can inform key stakeholders about where existing studies have been conducted and the quality of these. This will allow funders to see where research gaps exist and where there is already a saturation of available evidence. Through meta&#x02010;analysis we will explore whether certain subgroups of participants access services in different ways which will help understand the barriers that exist for various populations of people experiencing homelessness.</p><p>This systematic review will be based on evidence already identified in two existing evidence and gap maps (EGMs) commissioned by the Centre for Homelessness Impact (CHI) and built by White, Saran, Teixeira, Fitzpatrick, and Portes (<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The EGMs present studies on the effectiveness and implementation of interventions aimed at people experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, homelessness. The EGMs were constructed using a comprehensive search strategy including a search of Campbell, PROSPERO and Cochrane databases. The EGMs identified various systematic reviews which assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve both physical and mental health in homeless populations (Hwang, Tolomiczenko, Kouyoumdjian, &#x00026; Garner, <xref rid="cl21118-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Speirs, Johnson and Jirojwong,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Thomas, Gray and McGinty,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and reducing homelessness (Fitzpatrick&#x02010;Lewis et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Munthe&#x02010;Kaas, Berg and Blaasv&#x000e6;r,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) but fewer focus on those interventions which seek to improve access to HSC services.

A very useful online calculator has also been developed, this allows authors to choose the type of raw data available, and the calculator will automatically transform this to various effect size types, including the SMD (Lipsey &#x00026; Wilson,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cl21118-sec-0460"><label>4.3.13</label><title>Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</title><p>We will conduct a number of subgroup analyses to explore whether study, intervention or sample characteristics influenced the overall effect of the intervention on each outcome.

</p></sec><sec id="cl21118-sec-0470"><label>4.3.14</label><title>Treatment of qualitative research</title><p>The qualitative research included in this review is based upon existing evidence collated through an EGM constructed by White, Saran et al. (<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and White, Wood, and Fitzpatrick (<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0067" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The EGM was commissioned by the CHI and presents 292 qualitative process evaluations on the implementation issues of interventions designed to target homelessness. A process evaluation aims to examine how well the program is working and if its implementation followed the intended design. Qualitative evidence that examines the detail of how an intervention is delivered, accessed and experienced by providers and service users enable us to answer questions about why an intervention works (or does not work), who it works for and under what circumstances. This can be used to inform program and intervention development and service improvement. These were screened on 10th May 2019 for duplicates.</p><p>We will include process evaluations and other relevant qualitative studies that provide data that enables a deeper understanding of why an intervention does (or does not) work as intended, for whom and under what circumstances. We intend to describe the characteristics of included qualitative studies in terms of what qualitative methods have been used to capture this rich data, the number of interviews/focus groups/observations that have taken place, who participated and the nature of qualitative data collection (type and time taken). For example, Tinland et al. (<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0054" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) make direct observations on participants but additionally carry out in depth interviews and focus groups with policy makers and practitioners. Similarly, Luffborough (<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) carried out a mixed methods study by administering pre and posttest surveys to 108 homeless men, observing their participation in programme activities and interviewing a sample of 10 on their perceptions of the intervention. The implementation and process evaluations will be critical in this analysis, and data gathered from observations, focus groups and interviews will add an essential and unique human perspective to this review. By including an element of qualitative evidence synthesis in our review we hope to provide a more robust and rich review of the evidence base.</p><p>The categories included in the EGM describe the factors that impact upon interventions and the implementation of these across the gathered studies. These categories were developed using an iterative process and were initially based on the implementation science framework (Aarons, Hurlburt, &#x00026; Horwitz Sarah,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The categories were then independently piloted against process evaluations and agreement was reached by researchers in the Campbell Collaboration, Campbell UK and Ireland, and Herriot&#x02010;Watt University. The five broad categories or levels of influence agreed are contextual factors, policy makers/funders, programme managers/implementing agency, staff/case workers and recipients. The review team recognise that in the majority of interventions, more than one of the agreed categories could act as a factor that impacts positively or negatively on the effectiveness of the intervention, or both in some cases. For this reason, the review team will initially use a Framework synthesis methodology to synthesise implementation data from the EGM under the five broad categories agreed previously. The team are aware, however, that this framework may not categorise all factors sufficiently and may have to be adapted at a later stage.</p><p>Framework synthesis is an approach that originates from a process of analysing primary research data to address policy concerns. The background theoretical and empirical literature help create an understanding of the issue into an initial conceptual framework, which develops iteratively as new data are incorporated and themes are derived from the data. This process was carried out in collaboration with researchers and academics in Heriot Watt University and the Campbell Collaboration (White, Saran et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). This synthesis method presents an opportunity to use a scaffold against which findings from the different components may be brought together and organised (Carroll, Booth, &#x00026; Cooper,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Its flexibility captures new understanding as data are incorporated into the framework.</p><p>Framework synthesis comprises five methodological stages:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>Familiarisation</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>Framework Selection</p></list-item><list-item><label>3.</label><p>Indexing</p></list-item><list-item><label>4.</label><p>Charting</p></list-item><list-item><label>5.</label><p>Mapping and Interpretation</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>These stages are often overlapping and may be revisited throughout the process.</p><p>The first is the familiarisation stage in which a reviewer becomes familiar with current issues and ideas about the topic, by drawing iteratively on a variety of sources (Booth &#x00026; Carroll,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This leads to the second stage: framework selection where an initial framework is chosen, which might be a conceptual or policy framework, logic model, causal chain or established theory that might explain the issue (Brunton, Oliver, &#x00026; Thomas,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). During the third indexing stage, studies are searched for, screened and data extracted using the initial conceptual framework. Much of this work has been carried out in the development of the Implementation issues EGM (White, Saran et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Here, studies are sorted to determine their relevance to the review questions and to identify their main characteristics. During this stage, the Campbell UK and Ireland team will screen the process evaluations for relevance to the review. During the fourth charting stage, the main characteristics of each study will be analysed by grouping characteristics into categories and deriving themes directly from those data (Brunton&#x000a0;et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). At this stage, a process of purposive sampling (Booth et al., <xref rid="cl21118-bib-0066" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) will be completed by Campbell UK and Ireland. This purposive sample will endeavour to include process evaluations spanning geography, targeted populations and types of intervention in order to exhibit an accurate representation of accommodation programmes available. The selected process evaluations should present the most &#x0201c;rich&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;thick&#x0201d; data (Booth et al., <xref rid="cl21118-bib-0066" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) from the studies included in the map. At this stage, Campbell UK and Ireland will synthesis the available data from the selected studies against the original agreed framework embedded in the EGM. During the final stage of the mapping and interpretation stage, the derived themes will be considered in light of the original research questions (Brunton et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and in this case, policy implications. At this stage, the team will collaborate with content experts who will consider these themes in light of the available empirical and theoretical literature. In the relevant interventions available for meta&#x02010;analysis, some process evaluations of these interventions identified will be included in an additional thematic synthesis of qualitative data.</p><p>The quality of these mixed methods studies will be assessed using a tool developed by White and Keenan (<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0060" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Along with the tool, the review team intend to use a thematic synthesis methodology to generate new themes and create meaningful relationships between these themes (Fleming, Booth, Garside, Noyes, &#x00026; Tun&#x000e7;alp,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The tool is similar to the fidelity assessment used by Stergiopoulos and Politis (<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and aims to provide an accurate account of the eligible qualitative studies. The tool will consider methodology, recruitment and sampling, bias, ethics, analysis and findings, therefore providing a compelling justification for the inclusion of qualitative data. This tool will capture the factors that impact upon intervention effectiveness which can be viewed through the lens of all perspectives. For example, within the context of service delivery politics, policies, welfare and healthcare systems. Similarly, fidelity and implementation problems can impact upon the effectiveness of the intervention. From the perspective of the service user, who can access the services along with the barriers and facilitators of uptake will also impact on the effectiveness of the intervention. The experience that the service user receives in terms of acceptability and dropout rate will cause additional impact. All of these factors of impact along with lessons learnt by Soilemezi and Linceviciute (<xref rid="cl21118-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) will be carefully considered during the process of thematic synthesis.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="cl21118-sec-0480"><title>CONTRIBUTIONS OF AUTHORS</title><p>The review will be undertaken by systematic review specialists within the Campbell UK &#x00026; Ireland Centre.
