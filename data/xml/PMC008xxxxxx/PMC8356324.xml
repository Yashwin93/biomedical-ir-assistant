As compared with high&#x02010;income countries, policy responses in low&#x02010; and middle&#x02010;income countries (LMICs) are limited due to resource constraints and paucity of evidence for effective interventions to reduce violence against children in their own contexts, amongst other factors.</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0020"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of this evidence and gap map (EGM) is to provide an overview of the existing evidence available and to identify gaps in the evidence base on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce violence against children in LMICs. This report covers evidence published in English; a follow&#x02010;up study is under preparation focusing on evidence in five additional languages&#x02014;Arabic, Chinese, French, Portuguese and Spanish.</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0030"><title>Methods</title><p>The intervention&#x02010;outcome framework for this EGM is based on INSPIRE&#x02014;Seven Strategies for Ending Violence against Children, published by WHO and other partners in 2016. The seven strategies include&#x000a0;implementation and enforcement of laws; norms and values, safe environment; parent&#x02013;child and caregiver support; income and economic strengthening; response and support services; education and life skills. The search included both academic and grey literature available online. We included impact evaluations and systematic reviews that assessed the effectiveness of interventions to reduce interpersonal violence against children (0&#x02013;18 years) in LMICs (World Bank, 2018b). Interventions targeting subpopulation of parents, teachers and caregivers of 0&#x02013;18 years&#x02019; age group were also included. A critical appraisal of all included studies was carried out using standardised tools.</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0040"><title>Results</title><p>The map includes 152 studies published in English of which 55 are systematic reviews and 97 are impact evaluations. Most studies in the map are from Sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa. Education and life skills are the most widely populated intervention area of the map followed by income and economic strengthening interventions. Very few studies measure impact on economic and social outcomes, and few conduct cost&#x02010;analysis.</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0050"><title>Conclusion</title><p>More studies focusing on low&#x02010;income and fragile and conflict&#x02010;affected settings (FCS) and studying and reporting on cost&#x02010;analysis are required to address gaps in the evidence. Most interventions covered in the literature focused on addressing a wide range of forms of violence and harm, which limited understanding of how and for whom the interventions work in a given context, for specific forms of violence. More impact evaluation studies are required that assess specific forms of violence, gendered effects of interventions and on diverse social groups in a given context, utilising mixed methods.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="funding-0001"><funding-source>

The evidence base is concentrated in Sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa and South Asia, and select countries within these regions. South Africa, Ethiopia and India are the most represented countries.</p><p>There should be more studies from low&#x02010;income and conflict&#x02010;affected settings, and more cost&#x02010;analysis studies. Studies focusing on interventions linked to specific forms of violence, rather than multiple or unspecified forms of violence, could strengthen understanding of intervention effectiveness.</p><p>Overall, the EGM findings suggest the need to ensure increased investment in research to assess effectiveness of interventions, with specific attention to addressing thematic and geographical gaps.</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0120"><label>1.6</label><title>How up&#x02010;to&#x02010;date is this EGM?</title><p>The authors searched for studies published up to December 2019.</p></sec></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0130"><label>2</label><title>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</title><sec id="cl21120-sec-0140"><label>2.1</label><title>Background</title><p>More than 1 billion children&#x02014;over half the children in the world&#x02014;report having experienced some form of violence in a previous year (Hillis, Mercy, Amobi, &#x00026; Kress,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). VAC includes all forms of violence experienced by children aged 18 years and below, whether perpetrated by parents or other caregivers, peers, romantic partners, or strangers (WHO,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). As defined by UNICEF, the scope of violence includes, &#x0201c;all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse&#x0201d; (article 19, paragraph 1, of the Convention <xref rid="cl21120-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>)</p><p>In recognition of the enormity of the scale and impact of childhood violence, global actors have stepped up their focus to advocate for greater investment in violence prevention and response. A technical package supporting seven evidence&#x02010;based strategies to end VAC&#x02014;INSPIRE&#x02014;developed by the WHO, UNICEF and eight other international agencies and initiatives, has been widely promoted and adopted as an essential tool in supporting national investments and actions towards realising this commitment (WHO,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>). The Global Partnership to End Violence against Children, also launched in 2016, serves as a global platform aimed at &#x0201c;ending violence against children in every country, every community and every family&#x0201d; (Know Violence in Childhood,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and advocates broadly for the use of INSPIRE to accelerate the implementation of violence prevention interventions. These developments, along with significant global commitments articulated in the sustainable development goals (SDGs), have provided greater impetus for global, regional and national level actions to end violence.</p><p>Although considerable research on VAC in high&#x02010;income countries (HICs) is available, the same is not true for low&#x02010; and middle&#x02010;income countries (LMICs) as defined by World Bank country classification (World Bank,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>). The mapping of available evidence and especially the evidence required on effectiveness of interventions to reduce VAC is a priority area for policy and practice in LMICs (UNICEF,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>). This report summarises findings of phase 1 from an EGM of evidence published in English commissioned by UNICEF Office of Research&#x02014;Innocenti and undertaken by the Campbell Collaboration.

The construction of an EGM is the first step towards building an evidence architecture to end VAC (White,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The EGM will contribute to broadening the included interventions and outcomes in the INSPIRE framework to better reflect the state of evidence on VAC, and independently provide an updated overview of knowledge and evidence gaps for the field.</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0160"><label>2.1.2</label><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of this map is to provide an overview of the existing evidence base and gaps in evidence aimed at reducing VAC in LMICs using an intervention&#x02010;outcome framework based on the INSPIRE framework&#x02014;developed by the WHO, UNICEF and eight other international agencies and initiatives (WHO, <xref rid="cl21120-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>, <xref rid="cl21120-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>).</p><p>The INSPIRE framework lists seven evidence&#x02010;based strategies to end VAC:

Also, most of the evidence is found to be concentrated in few countries in Sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa and South Asia with South Africa, Ethiopia and India being the major countries of coverage. More studies focusing on low&#x02010;income and conflict&#x02010;affected settings are needed because violence affecting children is anticipated to be more prevalent in such settings. More impact evaluations are needed to assess the impact of more than one kind of strategy, evaluate effects for vulnerable populations, as well as report on cost&#x02010; analysis of interventions. The focus of majority of studies has been on impact of interventions on victims of violence or their parent/caregivers or teachers; however, there seemed to be gaps in studies assessing the impact of interventions on perpetration of violence. There is a need to conduct high&#x02010;confidence impact evaluations and systematic reviews.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="background" id="cl21120-sec-0360"><label>3</label><title>BACKGROUND</title><sec id="cl21120-sec-0370"><label>3.1</label><title>Introduction</title><sec id="cl21120-sec-0380"><label>3.1.1</label><title>The problem, condition or issue</title><p>VAC includes all forms of violence under 18 years of age, whether perpetrated by parents or other caregivers, peers, romantic partners, or strangers (WHO,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). As defined by UNICEF, the scope of violence includes, &#x0201c;all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse&#x0201d; (article 19, paragraph 1, of the Convention,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). It includes maltreatment, bullying, youth violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence and emotional or psychological violence (detailed definition given in Supporting Information Appendix 1).</p><p>More than 1 billion children between two to seventeen years&#x02014;half the children in the world&#x02014;report having experienced some form of interpersonal violence in a previous year (Hillis et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) Violence affects children in LMICs as well as in HICs; however, the burden and types of violence vary substantially between economies. Violence, exploitation and abuse against children occur in the homes, families, schools, care and other institutions, justice systems, workplaces and communities across all contexts, including online, and including as a result of conflict and natural disasters (UNICEF,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Globally, three in four children aged two to four worldwide experience violent disciplines by their caregivers on a regular basis; six in ten children are punished by physical means (UNICEF,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Violent discipline also takes place in schools: one in two school&#x02010;age children between six and 17 years live in countries where corporal punishment at school is not fully prohibited (UNICEF,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Gender&#x02010;based discrimination places girls at high risk of violence and its experience and impacts extend throughout the life course. The use of corporal punishment against adolescent girls is widespread and 84 million adolescent girls aged 15&#x02013;19 have been victims of emotional, physical or sexual violence at the hands of their husbands or partners at some point in their lives (UNICEF,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). A few striking features of childhood violence have drawn substantial international attention in the recent years. First, violence exposure starts early in childhood including through experience of corporal punishment recorded as early as age 1 (Devries et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Know Violence in Childhood,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Second, much of the violence experienced by children is at the hands of adults who are typically to be found within a circle of trust and caregiving&#x02014;parents, teachers, neighbours and authority figures. Third, there is also a striking rise in peer violence as children grow older and violence spills into peer relationships including through bullying (offline and online), dating and intimate partner violence, as well as gang violence (Know Violence in Childhood,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The gendered experience of violence also manifests as children grow older and transition to adolescence.</p><p>Vulnerability to violence is also experienced by children who face other violations of their rights such as early marriage or child labour. For instance, girls who marry before 18 are more likely to experience intimate partner violence than their peers who marry later (UNICEF,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2005a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0390"><label>3.1.2</label><title>Risk factors and context</title><p>Data suggest that risk factors for exposure to or experience of violence manifest differently across gender, age groups and context. WHO estimates that the highest child homicide rates occur in adolescents, especially boys, aged 15&#x02013;17 years and among 0&#x02013;4&#x02010;year&#x02010;old children (WHO,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). A 2011 review estimated the global lifetime prevalence of childhood sexual abuse to be about 18% for girls compared with 8% for boys (Stoltenborgh, Van IJzendoorn, Euser, &#x00026; Bakerman&#x02010;Kranenburg,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Girls all over the world are victims of child marriage, forced pregnancy, and female genital mutilation, particularly in LMICs. Despite wide variation by country, physical punishment is common in LMICs (Lansford &#x00026; Deater&#x02010;Deckard,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Prevailing social norms supporting harsh punishment of children and women and inadequate family support services and parenting practices have been documented in the context of physical punishments (Lansford, Deater&#x02010;Deckard, Bornstein, Putnick, &#x00026; Bradley,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0400"><label>3.1.3</label><title>Impact of VAC</title><p>The severity of the effects of violence experienced by children is magnified because of the serious intergenerational impacts on the future wellbeing of children as they transition to adulthood. Experience of violence during childhood increases the risk of becoming victims or perpetrators of violence during adulthood (WHO, <xref rid="cl21120-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>). Violence can negatively affect physical, mental, sexual, and reproductive health, and may increase the risk of acquiring HIV in some settings (WHO,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). VAC is associated with poor educational outcomes, economic insecurity including food insecurity, parental unemployment, inadequate housing and other basic necessities for children and families in LMICs (Peterman, Neijhoft, Cook, &#x00026; Palermo, <xref rid="cl21120-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The global costs related to physical, psychological and sexual VAC have been estimated to be between 3% and 8% of global GDP (Pereznieto, Montes, Routier, &#x00026; Langston,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0410"><label>3.1.4</label><title>Global attention to ending violence through prevention</title><p>Although experiencing violence in childhood impacts lifelong health and wellbeing, such violence is often preventable (WHO,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).

The year 2019 also marked the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which provides an important opportunity to galvanise further attention to the importance of ending VAC.</p><p>The Global Partnership to End Violence against Children, launched in 2016, serves as a global platform with the aim of &#x0201c;ending violence against children in every country, every community and every family&#x0201d; (End Violence against children, 2018). The Global Partnership has 30 &#x0201c;path finding&#x0201d; countries committed to investing in the technical package INSPIRE that promotes seven evidence&#x02010;based strategies to end VAC, developed by the WHO and nine other international agencies and initiatives. INSPIRE has been widely promoted and adopted as an essential tool in supporting national investments and actions towards realising this commitment (WHO, <xref rid="cl21120-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>). Global evidence synthesised in reports such as <italic toggle="yes">Ending Violence in Childhood: Global Report</italic> 2017 makes a strong case for the prevention of childhood violence and expanding investments in evidence&#x02010;informed strategies. Collectively all these initiatives, resources and platforms have created a space to develop a stronger evidence architecture to inform the acceleration of local, national, regional and global actions to end VAC.</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0430"><label>3.1.5</label><title>The EGM</title><sec id="cl21120-sec-0440"><title>What does this EGM include?</title><p>This EGM focuses specifically on violence experienced by children whether perpetrated by adults or peers.</p><p>The EGM is focused on effectiveness studies of interventions where the primary aim is the reduction of VAC.</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0450"><title>Approach</title><p>The INSPIRE framework has been identified as the basis for the intervention&#x02010;outcome framework for the present EGM (WHO, <xref rid="cl21120-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>, <xref rid="cl21120-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>).

The &#x0201c;INSPIRE handbook&#x0201d; explains in detail how to choose and contextually implement interventions and &#x0201c;Indicator Guidance and Results Framework&#x0201d; is designed to help governments and agencies to monitor progress and track change over time when INSPIRE strategies are implemented.</p><p>The INSPIRE framework supports efforts to achieve the SDG by aiming to reduce significantly all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere.</p><p>The intervention&#x02010;outcome framework used in the EGM is based on the INSPIRE framework (WHO, <xref rid="cl21120-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>) which identifies seven evidence&#x02010;based strategies to prevent VAC:

</p><p>The intervention categories are based on the seven strategies of INSPIRE; in addition, subcategories have been developed based on pilot coding of 30 key studies, expert advice and discussion within the team and advisory members. These are detailed in Chapter 4 of the report as well as in Supporting Information Appendix 1.</p><p>We use an adapted category for the first pillar of INSPIRE implementation and enforcement of laws, which we have expanded to include laws, crime, and justice in the present map. This deviation was based on the pilot coding of studies.</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0460"><title>What does this EGM aim to achieve?</title><p>To support global efforts to end violence, there is an increased need to invest in generating sound evidence on effective strategies to prevent or end VAC, in order to inform national and global actions as well as to point to the evidence gaps that need attention, and to those areas where evidence can be better utilised to inform policies and investments. The EGM aims to achieve this by collating available evidence and identifying gaps in evidence base where research might benefit from a systematic review, research synthesis or a impact evaluations.</p><p>In order to move towards the ambitious targets laid out in the SDG, it is likely that substantial improvements in resource allocation are needed to promote interventions which are effective in improving outcomes in particular contexts. The purpose of this EGM is to assist policy makers, researchers and practitioners in gaining access to available evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce VAC. Mapping the distribution and focus of available evidence will help both identifying areas where new impact evaluations are required, and evidence synthesis gaps where studies exist but require consolidation to understand findings. The EGM does not replace other impact evaluations or address specific methodological or other gaps, but instead lays out an assessment of evidence availability in order to guide further research investment.</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0470"><title>Rationale</title><p>Collecting reliable data on violence poses a challenge both in terms of gathering sensitive information as well as gaining access to vulnerable children in an ethical and safe way (UNICEF,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2005b</xref>). Governments in many HICs have recognised the high social and economic costs imposed by violence and introduced contextual interventions for preventing and responding to VAC. In many LMICs this is as yet not necessarily the case, and interventions are often the result of external funding and technical assistance rather than government endorsed initiatives. The SDGs&#x02019; articulation of the global commitment to end violence against women and children, platforms such as the Global Partnership to End Violence against Children, and the active role played by many national organisations and movements all play an important role in increasing national governments&#x02019; attention to the issue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-0480"><label>3.1.6</label><title>Existing EGMs and/or relevant systematic reviews</title><p>The Child Wellbeing Mega Map (UNICEF,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>) was a basis for developing the present EGM.

These are as follows:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Study design (potential confounders taken into account)</italic>: Impact evaluations need either a well&#x02010;designed control group (preferably based on random assignment) or an estimation technique that controls for confounding and the associated possibility of selection bias.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Power calculations</italic>: Small sample sizes can result in an underpowered study with a high risk of not detecting an effect from the intervention when there actually is one. The combination of underpowered studies and publication bias can put an upward bias on the assessment of the overall effect size from a body of literature. Power calculation helps to address the problem of sample size before the study to determine the required sample size. We have not used this item in the overall assessment of the study. However, coding a mention of power calculations signals the importance of both conducting and reporting power calculations.</p></list-item><list-item><label>3.</label><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Attrition or losses to follow&#x02010;up</italic>: can be a major source of bias in studies, especially if there is differential attrition between the treatment and comparison group (called the control group in the case of RCTs) so that the two may no longer be balanced in pre&#x02010;intervention characteristics. The US Institute of Education Sciences What Works Clearing House (WWC) has developed standards for acceptable levels of attrition, in aggregate and the differential.</p></list-item><list-item><label>4.</label><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Clear definition of violence</italic>: For a study to be useful, the study population must be clear, which means that the type and degree of violence must be clearly defined, preferably with reference to a widely used international standard.</p></list-item><list-item><label>5.</label><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Description of intervention</italic>: If the intervention is not well described then the evidence may be misinterpreted to support an intervention that is not actually supported by study findings. For example, &#x0201c;case work&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;shelter&#x0201d; are very broad descriptions, so more detail of the intervention is required so as to know what is actually being evaluated. We rate as low if the description is just named with no description, medium if there is a short description, and high if there is a detailed description. We do not use this item in the overall assessment of the study.</p></list-item><list-item><label>6.</label><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Definition of outcomes</italic>: Outcomes should be clearly defined so that study findings can be properly interpreted. As far as possible, unless a subjective perception is required, questions should rely on objective factors, and utilise data collection instruments which have been validated for the context in which they are being applied.

Given the obviously sensitive nature of research into VAC, it is indeed challenging to conduct such studies. The foundational commitment to &#x0201c;do no harm&#x0201d; that underpins all child protection work necessitates a central focus on ensuring the safety of respondents and appropriate and effective referral services, in line with the duty of care towards all children (UNICEF,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>). Further, every person has a right to privacy; hence preserving the confidentiality of personal information is one of the fundamental principles governing the collection of data about individuals. In line with the above stated challenges, an ethical adequacy tool for measuring the ethical standards of primary intervention/effects study was developed (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Population Council,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Save the Children,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; WHO,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>); UNICEF's child&#x02010;specific guidance for ethical evidence generation) for the impact evaluations included in this EGM.</p><p>The nine&#x02010;item tool had five critical and four non&#x02010;critical items. The scoring identified &#x0201c;Strong ethical standards&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Moderate ethical standards&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Weak ethical standards&#x0201d;. The complete tool with scoring can be found in the Supporting Information Appendix 8. We did not disqualify any study based on the adequacy of ethical standards.</p><p>We note that a uniformly used and standardised ethical appraisal tool does not exist for VAC studies that explicitly mention points on privacy, referral, adverse event protocol and informed consent.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="cl21120-sec-0830"><label>8</label><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="cl21120-sec-0840"><label>8.1</label><title>Description of studies</title><sec id="cl21120-sec-0850"><label>8.1.1</label><title>Results of the search</title><p>The screening process (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21120-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) resulted in 152 records to be included in Phase 1.

There is a clear need for more and better confidence impact evaluations across all INSPIRE categories and better use of systematic reviews and implementation research to complement more rigorous evaluations across many components of INSPIRE intervention categories. Geographical coverage remains skewed to a few regions and a few countries within them.</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-1270"><label>9.2</label><title>Areas of evidence concentration</title><p>Most of the impact evaluations measured impact of &#x0201c;education and life skills&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;income and economic strengthening&#x0201d; in reducing all forms of VAC. The intervention category &#x0201c;Parent, child and caregiver support&#x0201d; had a fair concentration of studies as well.</p><p>In terms of outcomes, impacts on &#x0201c;changing norms and values&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;health&#x0201d; impacts were the most studied outcomes apart from direct reduction of VAC.</p><p>The distribution of studies (systematic reviews and impact evaluations) across regions is uneven. As regions, Sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa and South Asia had the highest number of studies. Country&#x02010;wise South Africa, India, Uganda and Ethiopia have the largest number of studies.</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-1280"><label>9.3</label><title>Areas of major gaps in the evidence, and confidence considerations</title><p>Many areas of the map are sparsely populated and even the areas with existing evidence are generally of low confidence. There are pockets of high&#x02010;confidence evidence, but there is an overall low number of studies from LMICs in the area of VAC. Evidence gaps are noted in the areas of &#x0201c;law, crime and justice&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;safe environments&#x0201d;.</p><p>More detailed analysis of intervention&#x02010;outcome&#x02010;specific analysis reveal that even in high areas of evidence, there are pockets of evidence gaps. For example, though income and economic strengthening is fairly covered, there are gaps in evidence on insurance and welfare schemes and income generation and credit interventions. Similar gaps are seen in parent, child and caregiver support, where there are lack of studies on maternal/paternal mental health and peer&#x02010;relationship and training interventions.</p><p>An emerging insight from our EGM is that the evidence seems to be concentrated on reducing victimisation and there seem to be gaps in evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for perpetration of violence.</p><p>There seems to be differences in understanding and defining diverse forms of VAC, as our findings show that a large proportion of the studies reported interventions for &#x0201c;unclassified&#x0201d; types and forms of violence.</p><p>A significant share of the systematic review evidence base has methodological limitations. These limitations include unclear inclusion criteria for interventions and topics, no use of independent screening or data extraction, missing risk of bias assessments of included studies and use of vote&#x02010;counting approaches.</p><p>A significant share of impact evaluations also had methodological limitations. These limitations include high attrition rates, unclear interventions and outcome definition and lack of power calculations in the sample.</p><p>It was rare for studies to include information on cost&#x02010;analysis (including cost&#x02010;effectiveness and cost&#x02010;benefit analysis). There were only two studies that conducted cost&#x02010;analysis.</p><p>Evidence is scarce on assessing the effectiveness of &#x0201c;maternal and paternal mental health&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;children in care&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;media and communication&#x0201d; interventions. Only five studies noted the effectiveness of &#x0201c;insurance and welfare schemes&#x0201d; interventions in reduction of VAC and they are noted to be of medium to high confidence.</p><p>There are also evidence gaps in studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions for reduction of VAC of less than 3 years of age and of children belonging to ethnic minorities or children with disabilities.</p><p>There are major gaps in studies assessing the effectiveness of parent&#x02013;child and caregiver support on safety and risk factors for other harms and economic and social outcomes. Evidence was lacking in terms of the impact of the intervention area &#x0201c;response and support services&#x0201d; on economic and social outcomes.</p><p>There is limited evidence on the studies assessing effectiveness of interventions related to specific forms of violence such as intimate partner violence amongst children and adolescent, peer violence and corporal punishment.</p><p>There are very few studies from low&#x02010;income countries as compared with middle&#x02010;income countries (low and upper&#x02010;middle). This is of concern because many low&#x02010;income countries from the regions report high violence prevalence against children and the need for effective interventions is critical.</p><p>The EGM analysis showed that there are many studies from Sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa, but it is mainly concentrated in a few countries, particularly South Africa. Many LMICs from Sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa have minimal or no evidence (at least in English language publications). Gaps from Francophone Sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa and other regions such as Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa may be addressed in Phase 2 when evidence published in five other languages&#x02014;Arabic, Chinese, French, Portuguese and Spanish&#x02014;are included in the EGM.</p></sec><sec id="cl21120-sec-1290"><label>9.4</label><title>Limitations of the EGM</title><p>Violence is as complex issue, with a range of intersecting forms, drivers and risk factors operating at the level of the child, family, community and wider institutions. This EGM has been based on an as expansive a framework as possible, though limitations may remain in the scope and approach.

<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>The EGM should be the basis to identify gaps in evidence such as on key intervention areas and forms of violence, so that investments in research can be better targeted to address gaps.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>The EGM finds that there is a need to improve the confidence of impact evaluations. This includes standardising definitions of violence used, study design, implementation and also reporting.</p></list-item><list-item><label>3.</label><p>Organisations funding research need to direct more funding and give strategic priority to confidence impact evaluations, mixed&#x02010;method studies and systematic reviews, designed to improve and strengthen methodology, and require their grantees to conduct long&#x02010;term follow&#x02010;up surveys and cost&#x02010;analyses.</p></list-item><list-item><label>4.</label><p>Researchers should increase measurement of changes in gendered social norms as an outcome; and include vulnerable populations, such as children with disabilities, children in institutions, children who are street&#x02010;connected, and children from low&#x02010;income group and ethnic minorities, in the sample.</p></list-item><list-item><label>5.</label><p>The requirement to report on the application of ethical standards must be made mandatory as part of funding applications, as well as research publication. There is a need for a specific, tailored tool for ethical appraisal of research on violence, and ethical considerations need to be included in confidence appraisals as well.</p></list-item><list-item><label>6.</label><p>The EGM should be made a living review and expanded to include qualitative literature, to provide a database for researchers to update with relevant literature, as well as for policy makers and other stakeholders to have easily accessible summaries of relevant literature for their interest.</p></list-item><list-item><label>7.</label><p>More high&#x02010;confidence impact evaluations should be funded and implemented. One way to ensure confidence can be by adhering to the standardised international checklists for relevant study design (available for impact evaluations as well as for systematic reviews) and making training available and adaptable to context.</p></list-item><list-item><label>8.</label><p>In the areas of high evidence concentration such as education and life skills and income and economic strengthening, evidence summaries should be generated gain an idea of the extent of the developing country literature, and also to develop taxonomy of approaches relevant in these contexts.</p></list-item><list-item><label>9.</label><p>As a next step, this EGM can provide a preliminary content for the web based evidence portal for VAC in LMICs.

The maps are a first building block to construct an evidence architecture for the sector. There is considerable need for more research to widen and deepen understanding on what works to reduce VAC in different settings.
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>&#x027a3;</label><p>A more standardised approach (adaptable to context) is required to generate evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing different types and forms of violence. Currently, there seem to be overlaps between different forms of violence without clear delineation in many studies. Researchers must address effectiveness of interventions for specific forms of violence in different contexts to have a better understanding on what works, where, why and for whom.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x027a3;</label><p>More studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of interventions for perpetration of VAC within the INSPIRE interventions framework.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x027a3;</label><p>More studies are needed from low&#x02010;income and conflict&#x02010;affected settings.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x027a3;</label><p>More high&#x02010;confidence systematic reviews and impact evaluations need to be commissioned with standardised guidelines and tailored guidance to ensure robustness, as most of them included in the map were found to be of low confidence.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x027a3;</label><p>More impact evaluations are needed that report outcomes for vulnerable groups of children, requiring larger sample sizes in studies and better disaggregation in study design, methodology and reporting.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x027a3;</label><p>More impact evaluations are needed that assess gendered effects of interventions and on diverse social groups in a given context, utilising mixed methods to better understand for whom the interventions work, and how.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x027a3;</label><p>Ethical standards need to be better&#x02010;defined and made a mandatory component of all research studies.
