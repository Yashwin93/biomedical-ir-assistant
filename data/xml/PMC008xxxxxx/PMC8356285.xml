The Organization for Economic Co&#x02010;operation and Development (OECD) estimated that approximately 9% of current jobs within OECD member states are threatened with automation and digitalization&#x02014;all significant successes and advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, and computer science (Arntz et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). With such global changes and forecasts, in the labor market, there are ever&#x02010;evolving demands on employees and employers to gain or update new and/or different skill sets and competencies. Governments and policy&#x02010;makers at various levels have shifted towards investments and surveillance of various types of job training and skills acquisitions (OECD,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Active labor market programs help to bring individuals into employment, keep workers employed, optimize productivity and earnings through various means (Brown &#x00026; Koettl,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Further to the threat of automation and digitalization, international organizations are monitoring and estimating labor market trends considering COVID&#x02010;19 and its impact on the various economies worldwide. As of September 22nd, 2020, there have been over 31 million cases and over 960,000 deaths associated with COVID&#x02010;19 (John Hopkins University,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) with numbers still increasing daily. The consequences of this pandemic will include a significant disruption and impact on global unemployment and underemployment rates, implications for the quality of work available with reduced income, and working poverty, and worsening social inequalities and inequities as less access to social protection may also impact the quality of work done by employees (International Labor Organization,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Furthermore, these critical implications can contribute to a global economic recession (UN Conference for Trade and Development,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). COVID&#x02010;19 has led to increased demand for some occupations and shortage in specific skills as well as social displacement of workers, for example, some staff have been redeployed to new posts and newly trained healthcare professionals were introduced earlier than expected into needed posts (such as screening for COVID&#x02010;19). Evidence on effects of labor market programs to reduce unemployment from previous economic crises may be applicable to the COVID&#x02010;19 recovery plan. A key challenge will be to reduce unemployment by skills development and training, whether through upskilling to remain acquainted with and ensure skills match present labor market needs, or reskilling. The UN suggests that skills development programs may be a part of a policy response to COVID&#x02010;19. Skills development and training is important by virtue of the outcomes they can produce at both the system, employer, and individual levels.</p></sec><sec id="cl21126-sec-0030"><label>1.2</label><title>The intervention</title><p>Different interventions involving formal education, informal training, and other learning activities can contribute to technical and soft adult skills development necessary in the labor market. The types of interventions include career support, pathway guidance, assessment, funding, wraparound support (e.g., childcare, coaching), accreditation, training delivery (in&#x02010;person, digital, practitioner&#x02010;led training, by public or private providers; Orlik,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). These interventions are often provided in various combinations and may be geared toward paid employment or self&#x02010;employment. They can lead to an impact at the participant level (e.g., skills, employment and retention, earnings), and at the level of the employer (e.g., retention, hire quality) and the system (e.g., diversity of workforce/equity, community well&#x02010;being). Although many programs have a positive impact on participants, employers and labor market systems, some negative impacts such as reduced wages and displacement have occurred as a result of imbalance in labor demand and supply (Brown &#x00026; Koettl,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Cr&#x000e9;pon et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). See the conceptual framework of interventions and outcomes we developed in consultation with stakeholders who have expertise in skills development and policy (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" fig-type="Figure" id="cl21126-fig-0001"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Conceptual framework of interventions and outcomes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CL2-16-e1126-g001" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-1"/></fig></sec><sec id="cl21126-sec-0040"><label>1.3</label><title>Why it is important to develop the evidence and gap map (EGM)</title><p>An evidence and gap map EGM is a decision making and research prioritization tool used to identify areas of evidence as well as gaps in research to inform social policy, program, and research priorities (Snilstveit et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The roles of artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies in economies have gained prominence among governmental and legislative policy agendas (Jansen et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). This EGM is aligned with the priorities of the Future Skills Centre (FSC), a pan&#x02010;Canadian initiative, and who will be the map's primary user. FSC's mandate is to connect ideas and innovations generated across Canada so that employees and employers may thrive in the labor market, and to ensure that economies at the local, regional, and national levels flourish. Working with their partners to inform and support local approaches to skills development and employment training in ever&#x02010;changing economies, FSC will use this rapid and evidence gap map to direct their future research agenda, which is time&#x02010;sensitive due to the social and economic consequences of COVID&#x02010;19.</p></sec><sec id="cl21126-sec-0050"><label>1.4</label><title>Existing EGMs and/or relevant systematic reviews</title><p>Similar EGMs exists with a focus on higher levels of education and skills (Winters,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), funding for adult skills development (Gloster et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and youth skill development in low&#x02010;middle income countries (Rankin et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Two systematic reviews have also been conducted one on vocational and business training and women's labor market outcomes in low&#x02010;and middle&#x02010;income countries (Chinen et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and the other on youth employment programs and labor market outcomes in high&#x02010; and low&#x02010;middle income countries (Kluve et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p><p>Since there are existing EGMs for skills development in low&#x02010; and middle&#x02010;income countries and the setting for skills development is different in low&#x02010;resource settings, we decided to focus on high&#x02010;income country evidence for this EGM.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="objectives" id="cl21126-sec-0060"><label>2</label><title>OBJECTIVES</title><p>The objective of this EGM is to identify primary studies and systematic reviews on the effects of adult skills development and training on outcomes for the jobseeker/employee, employer and labor market systems in high income countries.</p></sec><sec id="cl21126-sec-0070"><label>3</label><title>METHODOLOGY</title><sec id="cl21126-sec-0080"><label>3.1</label><title>Defining EGMs</title><p>We will adapt EGM methods from key methods papers (Bragge et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Lum et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Snilstveit et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and will adopt the suggested five&#x02010;stage process:

The FSC Common Outcomes Framework is a set of measures that focus on employment&#x02010;related outcomes approaches both within Canada and internationally. We held a stakeholder workshop in February 2020 with academics, economists, and community&#x02010;based organizations in order to refine our interventions&#x02010;outcomes framework. Workshop participants suggested a recategorization of the framework categories and filter options, and these will be used in our map. The framework will follow a standard intervention and outcomes matrix where the rows are interventions and the columns are outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="cl21126-sec-0100"><label>3.3</label><title>Conceptual framework of the EGM</title><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> is our conceptual framework in which the inputs lead to the intended outcomes. Interventions, services, or programs are dependent upon investments from governments and or related stakeholders, as well as research. Through the skills development interventions, individuals acquire the skills and training to optimize their potential in the labor market.</p><p>This conceptual framework includes skills development interventions which recognize and seek to overcome systemic barriers to equitable employment, such as lack of sufficient wrap&#x02010;around support, need for culturally responsive interventions and need for commitment and activation measures from employers to ultimately support a diverse workforce and promote community well&#x02010;being.</p></sec><sec id="cl21126-sec-0110"><label>3.4</label><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>We will include studies which assess the impact of interventions or programs with a component of skills development and/or training among individuals post high school age.

The scale provides a score from 1 to 5, where 1 is the least robust (e.g., cross&#x02010;sectional comparison of treated groups with untreated groups) and 5 is the most robust (e.g., randomized controlled trials). We included primary studies if the methods scored between levels 3 and 5. The included levels are defined as follows:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>Level 3: outcomes are compared in intervention group before and after the intervention, and the comparison group is used to provide a counterfactual.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>Level 4: the intervention and control groups vary in their exposure to the random allocation of the intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><label>3.</label><p>Level 5: research designs that involve explicit randomization into intervention and control groups.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>For systematic reviews, we will include studies that explicitly describe the methods used to identify studies (i.e., a search strategy), strategies for study selection (e.g., eligibility criteria and selection process) and methods of synthesis or analysis (Moher et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21126-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).
