A study estimating the health and economic impact of routine immunisation for the period 2001&#x02013;2020, found that introduction and/or increased coverage of vaccines are projected to avert over 14 million deaths, 350 million cases of illness, 8 million cases of long&#x02010;term disability and 700 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) (Ozawa et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Yet rates of routine vaccination of children in low&#x02010; and middle&#x02010;income countries (LMICs) are strikingly low or stagnant, leading to a high disease burden and high infant and child mortality. In 2017, an estimated 19.9 million infants worldwide were not reached with routine immunisation services. Around 60% of these children live in 10 low&#x02010;and&#x02010;middle income countries, including Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Pakistan (&#x0201c;Immunization coverage,&#x0201d;&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Furthermore, national averages on immunisation coverage often obscure the underlying disparities within countries, and as a result, inequalities in immunisation often go unobserved or are underreported (Restrepo&#x02010;M&#x000e9;ndez et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Therefore, there is an urgent need for interventions that improve immunisation of children in these countries.</p><p>A number of innovative approaches to this problem have arisen in recent years. These approaches include strategies and technologies that enhance communities' participation in the planning, delivery, monitoring and uptake of routine vaccinations of children. These strategies have received considerable attention from funders, researchers, and practitioners (UNICEF, n.d.; WHO,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, there is at present a dearth of rigorous and systematic evidence about the effectiveness and cost&#x02010;effectiveness of these interventions. There is therefore a need to make such evidence available to guide policymakers and public health practitioners in making informed decisions about these interventions. This review will systematically analyse the literature on this topic, conduct causal chain analysis to identify key facilitators and inhibitors of intervention success, and perform cost&#x02010;effectiveness analysis to assess the value&#x02010;for&#x02010;money of enhancing community participation to improve immunisation of children.</p></sec><sec id="cl21119-sec-0030"><label>1.2</label><title>The intervention</title><p>The review will focus on all interventions that use community participation or engagement to improve routine immunisation coverage of children.</p><sec id="cl21119-sec-0040"><label>1.2.1</label><title>How do we define a community?</title><p>Communities may be identified in multiple ways. Writing in the <italic toggle="yes">Bulletin of the World Health Organization</italic>, Marston et al. (<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, p. 376) define communities as &#x0201c;groups of people who share common interests, concerns or identities in settings that are defined by geography, culture, administrative boundaries or geopolitical region or that are identified with joint activities, such as work or recreation.&#x0201d; In this systematic review (SR), we define &#x0201c;communities&#x0201d; in reference to the administrative boundaries of the lowest level of the health service delivery system (or whatever level provides routine immunisation services in the local context). We prefer this over those defined by a geographical boundary, such as a village, as in some contexts the lowest level of health service delivery system provide services to multiple villages. For the purposes of our review, a community comprises a group of people who are served by a particular primary health facility (e.g., a subdistrict&#x02010;level health centre). Thus, communities encompass a wide range of stakeholders, including caregivers, health service providers, and influential community members such as religious or other traditional leaders. Therefore, our review will include any intervention that is directed towards any of the above types of community members. Interventions that target higher levels of the health system&#x02014;such as a programme to improve state&#x02010;level officials' use of immunisation&#x02010;related data&#x02014;will be excluded.</p></sec><sec id="cl21119-sec-0050"><label>1.2.2</label><title>What is community participation?</title><p>We define community participation as a process wherein communities are included, to various degrees, in planning, decision&#x02010;making and implementation of activities that directly impact them (Stuart,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0055" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).

For example, an intervention to inform or educate community members about the importance of immunisation could engage communities at the <italic toggle="yes">inform</italic> level (if communities are merely told that an informational campaign will be introduced in their area), at the <italic toggle="yes">empower</italic> level (if community members direct and manage all aspects of designing and implementing the informational campaign), or at any level in between. Similarly, interventions to motivate community members or increase health provider capacity could engage communities at any of these levels. In addition, a programme might also engage different community members at different levels (for different components of the same programme) or the level of engagement for the same set of participants may change over the course of a programme (Hardy,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>However, it is important to note that the participation spectrum does not assume one level of participation to be better than the others or imply that the deeper the level of engagement, the better. In other words, the spectrum does not classify the participation levels into a hierarchy. Relatedly, the <italic toggle="yes">quality</italic> of engagement is distinct from the <italic toggle="yes">level</italic> of involvement&#x02014;that is, although the spectrum is arranged from less to more substantive, the fact that interactions are more substantive does not always mean they are of higher quality. Thus, an intervention at one of the higher levels of involvement may still be deficient in the way it incorporates community input and feedback because of poor design or implementation. For example, an intervention could make efforts to understand community concerns and consider them in decision&#x02010;making, and thus be classified as an <italic toggle="yes">involve</italic>&#x02010;level programme. But those efforts to understand may be weak, or community concerns may be considered but ultimately given minimal weight in decision&#x02010;making.</p><p>It is also important to note that the spectrum aims to capture a wide range of ways that intervention implementers can interact with communities. Although simply informing a community that an intervention is being implemented is arguably not participatory (and hence, interventions at the inform level are arguably not &#x0201c;community participation&#x0201d; interventions), we rely on the Spectrum of Public Participation because it is an established framework for understanding community engagement. In particular, including interventions at the <italic toggle="yes">inform</italic> level in our review will allow us to assess the hypothesis, implicit in the design of many community&#x02010;engagement interventions, that informing communities is an insufficient level of engagement to effect change.</p></sec></sec><sec id="cl21119-sec-0060"><label>1.3</label><title>How the interventions might work</title><p>A 2015 3ie scoping paper (Sabarwal et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) systematically mapped the literature on immunisation interventions and also consulted several programme managers and policy experts to understand why community participation could be the key to improving immunisation outcomes for children in areas where the coverage has stagnated or declined or that are hard to reach. The findings from the scoping study indicate that working with or engaging communities could help develop an understanding of the context, target population, problems and barriers, and lead to identification of contextually relevant solutions and desired outcomes, and mobilising community support for them. In addition, existing literature on behaviour change (Bicchieri &#x00026; Xiao,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Reynolds, Suba&#x00161;i&#x00107;, &#x00026; Tindall,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) highlights the importance of recognising that individuals usually function under the influence of social norms, that is, they respond to their peers and community, and while activities such as information and education campaigns might have some influence, individuals might feel bound by collective decisions (Riedy,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The role of peers and of social norms in shaping attitudes towards vaccination is particularly important given that vaccine hesitancy has been documented in countries of all income levels (although it takes very different forms in different countries; see Dub&#x000e9;, Gagnon, Nickels, Jeram, &#x00026; Schuster,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Moreover, there is systematic evidence from both high&#x02010;income countries (HICs; O'Mara&#x02010;Eves et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and LMICs (De Buck et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) that community engagement can be an effective model of modifying health behaviours in particular. Hence, community engagement could be a very important determinant of success or failure of an intervention aimed at improving immunisation coverage.</p><p>It is unlikely that any single theory of change would be able to capture all the different ways in which community participation (across the spectrum) affects immunisation outcomes. In particular, there is no strict correspondence between levels or types of engagement and specific intervention activities. For example, consider a proposed programme that aims to provide reminders to caregivers for immunisation. At less intensive levels of community participation, decisions related to the design and execution of the programme may have been undertaken by the sponsoring agency with limited inputs from the community. On the other hand, a similar programme can also result from conversations with the community, where members identify access to immunisation as a barrier because caregivers do not know when and where to take their children for immunisation, while at the same time the delivery of services is irregular. Additionally, the same participation process may also be leveraged to seek more substantive inputs from community members, including the frontline health workers, for designing the mode and content of reminders, targeting the hardest&#x02010;to&#x02010;reach households, and for mobilising the community at large. This example highlights how different intensity levels of community participation could give rise to the same activity involving reminders, which in turn could lead to improvement in access to immunisation services and an eventual increase in immunisation rates.</p><p>Importantly, the theory of change linking community participation to immunisation outcomes does not specify a precise causal mechanism whereby specific intervention activities yield specific behavioural responses and outcomes. Rather, the theory assumes that different barriers to immunisation exist in different communities, and that different categories of activities will be best suited to addressing those barriers. The underlying logic of using community participation to increase immunisation coverage is that engaging communities can be an effective way to (a) identify activities that will address the immunisation barriers extant in that community, and (b) implement those activities in ways that are appropriate for the local context.</p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides a simplified theory of change for how various types of immunisation activities, grounded in different levels of community participation, might lead to improved immunisation outcomes for children. The activities are broadly classified as two types: beneficiary/community&#x02010; and provider&#x02010;oriented. These activities lead to outputs and outcomes related to improvement in demand for, delivery of, and access to immunisation services. This ultimately leads to improved timely uptake of vaccination(s) and an increase in full immunisation rates. As noted above, the precise causal mechanisms that begin with community engagement and end with improved immunisation rates will differ depending on the level of participation utilised and the nature of the activities selected; consequently, the theory of change does not depict the full details of each involvement level's mode of action. However, note that the theory does rely on the assumption that in order to produce the desired results, specific expertise, commitment, and resources will be required to engage the community effectively at the intended level of participation. The details of the theory of change&#x02014;and in particular, how different levels of involvement will trigger different causal sequences&#x02014;will be further developed in the course of the review and evidence synthesis.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="Figure" id="cl21119-fig-0001"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Simplified intervention theory of change</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CL2-16-e1119-g001" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-1"/></fig><sec id="cl21119-sec-0070"><label>1.3.1</label><title>Why it is important to do the review</title><p>There are a number of existing SRs that address the effectiveness of interventions to increase immunisation coverage. However, none of these reviews are adequate for the purpose of guiding policymakers in deciding whether and how to pursue strategies that substantively involve various members of the community to address barriers all along the causal chain leading to vaccination delivery. We also believe it is important to have a review specific to LMICs. Many LMICs face similar barriers to achieving universal immunisation coverage, such as low rates of institutional births and poor infrastructure, which create logistical challenges for maintaining vaccination stocks and cold chains. In addition, health professionals in LMICs typically have lower literacy and skill levels which presents challenges for the delivery of quality immunisation services (Abejirinde, Ilozumba, Marchal, Zweekhorst, &#x00026; Dieleman,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Rowe et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). As these specific barriers are largely absent in HICs, reviews in which much of the evidence comes from HICs are of limited relevance to the needs of policymakers in LMICs.</p><p>Below we list 10 existing reviews and briefly document why they do not already accomplish the goals of our proposed review; see &#x0201c;References&#x0201d; section for full references.</p><p>Batt et al. (<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>): This review covers only grey literature and is nearly 15 years old.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Glenton et al. (<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>): This review covers the use of lay health workers for increasing immunisation rates. While this overlaps with our proposed focus, our review will encompass other types of interventions that encourage community participation beyond those involving lay health workers (e.g., interventions aimed at community leaders and caregivers). In addition, only about half of the studies included in this review were conducted in LMICs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Kaufman et al. (<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>): While the interventions covered in this review overlap with those in our proposed SR, there are key differences in scope. Kaufman et al.'s review covers only face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face interventions, whereas our review will include studies using any form of communicating with community members, including mass media and ICT (information and communication technology) modalities. In addition, 7 of 10 studies included in this review were conducted in HICs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lassi and Bhutta (<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>): Similar to our proposed review, the scope of Lassi et al.'s review is related to both community engagement as an intervention strategy and child health as an outcome. However, Lassi et al.'s review focuses on neonatal health and thus excludes many immunisation&#x02010;related interventions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mureed et al. (<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>): The reporting in this review is limited so it is not clear what interventions were included in the scope of the review. In addition, the review did not include grey or non&#x02010;English literature and lacks key policy&#x02010;relevant components such as causal path analysis and cost&#x02010;effectiveness information.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Oyo&#x02010;Ita et al. (<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>): This review is comprehensive and recent, covering a broad range of interventions targeting DPT immunisation in LMICs. However, this review covers only interventions that target either caregivers or health service providers, whereas our review will also include interventions aimed primarily at other community members (such as religious or other community leaders). Thus, an intervention that aimed to improve immunisation coverage by enlisting influential community members (who may not have young children themselves) to spread information about the importance of immunisation would not meet the intervention criteria reported in Oyo&#x02010;Ita et al.'s review, but would be included in ours. In addition, the literature in this area is expanding rapidly, so we anticipate that there will be a substantial amount of new evidence to be included in our review.<xref rid="cl21119-fn-note-0001" ref-type="fn">1</xref> Moreover, we plan to look at outcomes beyond DPT3 in our review and use an analysis framework focusing on levels of community participation which is different from the one used in this review.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pegurri et al.

</p><p>Even though immunisation coverage in LMICs has increased in recent years, many WHO&#x02010;member countries still struggle to reach the target of 90% coverage for DPT and provide equitable access to life&#x02010;saving vaccines (WHO,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0063" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>). Even with strengthened routine immunisation programmes, marginalised and vulnerable communities&#x02014;which may also be geographically or socially secluded&#x02014;are susceptible to being left out. Increasingly, international and national policy frameworks emphasise community participation or engagement to increase immunisation coverage and reach the hardest&#x02010;to&#x02010;reach (UNICEF, n.d.; WHO,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0062" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0063" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0064" ref-type="bibr">2017b</xref>). This includes educating community members about immunisation and its importance, getting their feedback on developing viable solutions to improving immunisation services, motivating them to take action to improve coverage, collaborating with them to identify and resolve issues that contribute to low immunisation rates, and empowering them to develop and improve systems for immunisation service delivery that fit the local context.</p><p>For instance, in 2011 the Ethiopian government launched a social mobilisation scheme, the Health Development Army, organising women from rural communities into volunteer networks to promote proper maternal and child health practices, including immunisation (Adamsu &#x00026; Salama,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Similarly, in 2014, the central government of India launched Mission Indradhanush (MI), which besides involving health administration at various levels, also involves community&#x02010;level workers to enlist beneficiaries in areas where routine immunisation coverage is weak. MI is also mobilising communities using communication strategies to improve immunisation (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Several other countries and international organisations have also adopted similar policies to strengthen planning, delivery and uptake of health services in order to reach the children, especially in the most vulnerable and marginalised populations. Reflecting the demand for evidence on the effectiveness of these approaches, the Gates Foundation, in collaboration with the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), has commissioned a series of impact evaluations on immunisation interventions with a focus on community participation.<xref rid="cl21119-fn-note-0004" ref-type="fn">4</xref>

We will conduct a broad, systematic search, apply consistent criteria to the screening of studies for inclusion, and, where appropriate, synthesise studies through meta&#x02010;analysis. We will present the findings of the review in forest plots and a &#x0201c;Summary of Findings&#x0201d; table.</p><p>Items retrieved through the search will be imported to EPPI&#x02010;Reviewer 4 and independently screened by two trained reviewers at the title/abstract and full&#x02010;text levels. At the title/abstract level, we will use EPPI&#x02010;Reviewer's machine learning and text mining features to prioritise citations that are likely to be included and to exclude items that are very unlikely to be included (O'Mara&#x02010;Eves, Thomas, McNaught, Miwa, &#x00026; Ananiadou,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Thomas, McNaught, &#x00026; Ananiadou,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). We will begin by manually screening 1,000 random records to train the machine learning algorithm, and have EPPI&#x02010;Reviewer order the remaining records according to their probability of inclusion as determined by EPPI&#x02010;Reviewer's algorithm. We will then set the EPPI&#x02010;Reviewer algorithm to learn continuously as we screen more records, and to continually re&#x02010;order remaining records according to their probability of inclusion. Thus, as we screen from the top of the list, records with low probabilities of inclusion will continue to be pushed further to the bottom of the list. When we reach a point where we exclude 500 consecutive records, we will automatically exclude the remaining titles (i.e., those with an even lower probability of inclusion than the 500 consecutive exclusions). We will, however, screen a random sample of the automatically excluded records to verify the accuracy of the algorithm.</p><p>Full&#x02010;text screening will be conducted by two independent reviewers, with disagreements resolved through discussion (and the lead author making final decisions on any contested cases). We will document the screening process so that a PRISMA flow chart and a table of characteristics of excluded studies can be provided in the review.</p><sec id="cl21119-sec-0100"><label>3.1</label><title>Criteria for including and excluding studies</title><sec id="cl21119-sec-0110"><label>3.1.1</label><title>Types of study designs</title><p>The review will include experimental and quasiexperimental studies that estimate the causal impact of an intervention, as compared to usual practice, by establishing a counterfactual. The review will include studies with the following designs:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Randomised controlled trials</p></list-item><list-item><p>Regression discontinuity designs</p></list-item><list-item><p>Instrumental variables estimation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Statistical matching (e.g., propensity score matching)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Difference&#x02010;in&#x02010;differences</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fixed effects estimation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Interrupted time series analysis</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>We include both experimental and quasiexperimental designs because randomisation is often impractical or unethical in the context of development interventions. The above designs are all established methods for drawing causal inferences about an intervention's effects (Shadish, Cook, &#x00026; Campbell,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). There will be no inclusion restrictions based on study publication status.</p><p>We will not impose any restrictions based on language of publication. Between members of the review team and consultants, we will have the capacity to screen and extract data from studies in Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese and French. If our search retrieves potentially relevant studies in other languages, we will attempt to find qualified reviewers to screen and, if they meet our inclusion criteria, extract data from these studies.</p><p>The review will include only studies that measure the <italic toggle="yes">effectiveness</italic> of an intervention, rather than studies of <italic toggle="yes">efficacy</italic>. Because studies fall along a continuum from efficacy to effectiveness, rather than fitting cleanly into one category or the other (Singal, Higgins, &#x00026; Waljee,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Thorpe et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0057" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), we will not have precise determinative criteria to distinguish efficacy from effectiveness studies. Rather, we will use a set of questions to guide the decision of whether to classify a study as an efficacy trial (and hence ineligible for inclusion). The more a study exhibits the characteristics described in the questions below, the stronger will be the case for classifying it as an efficacy trial.<xref rid="cl21119-fn-note-0005" ref-type="fn">5</xref> Reviewers will be trained to flag any unclear cases for further review and discussion, with the lead author making final decisions on any contested cases.</p></sec><sec id="cl21119-sec-0120"><label>3.1.2</label><title>Research objective</title><p>

</p><p>Although outcomes related to coverage and timeliness of vaccinations are the primary focus of this review, a wide range of additional outcomes are included to capture necessary upstream conditions (e.g., demand for and access to immunisation services) and key downstream effects (e.g., morbidity and mortality) of the primary outcomes. In addition, although some outcome measures might differ in degree (full, partial or no routine immunisation) or might be a subset of each other (dropout after DPT1/Penta 1 will be categorised as partially immunised), the outcomes are wide ranging to account for the differences and preferences of authors in reporting them.</p><p>Both official health records (including vaccination cards) and parent recall will be considered acceptable measures of immunisation coverage. If a study reports both types of measures, we will extract data on both. We will note which measure the authors believe to be more reliable and treat this as the default &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; measure of the outcome. However, we will conduct sensitivity analysis to determine whether using a different coverage measure significantly affects the results of our analysis.</p><p>Although there are standardised tools for measuring constructs like parental attitudes towards vaccination (e.g., Oladejo et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Shapiro et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), these have not yet been universally adopted or validated for populations of interest to this review (e.g., rural populations in LMICs).

When studies include multiple outcome measures to assess related outcome constructs (e.g., measuring access to immunisation services through both number of days when health workers are present at health facilities and number of days when vaccines are stocked), we will select the outcome that appears to most accurately reflect the outcome construct of interest.</p></sec><sec id="cl21119-sec-0250"><label>3.5</label><title>Critical appraisal</title><sec id="cl21119-sec-0260"><label>3.5.1</label><title>Assessment of risk of bias in experimental and quasiexperimental studies (Review Questions 1&#x02013;2)</title><p>We will assess risk of bias based on categories of bias recommended by the Cochrane Non&#x02010;Randomised Studies Group and procedures recommended by Waddington et al.

While the exact set of moderators will be determined as we learn more about the characteristics of included studies, at a minimum we will (again, assuming meta&#x02010;analysis is feasible at all) present meta&#x02010;analyses that stratify by study design (experimental vs. quasiexperimental), by risk of bias, and by level of community involvement. In addition, we hope to be able to analyse the role of <italic toggle="yes">quality</italic> of engagement as a moderator, though we may be limited by the detail of reporting in included studies.</p><p>More generally, as we continue to refine our theory of change, we will identify key pathways in the causal chain and identify study characteristics that could plausibly make a difference to the functioning of these pathways.</p><p>If there are more than 10 studies reporting the same outcome that can be combined in a meta&#x02010;analysis, we will use funnel plots to examine risk of bias due to missing results (Page, Higgins, &#x00026; Sterne,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p><p>To incorporate cost data and to undertake cost effectiveness analysis, we will largely follow the methodology in Dhaliwal et al. (<xref rid="cl21119-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). We expect that most of this data will not be found in the published papers, so we anticipate having to go back to authors to collect this data. Costs will include the costs of administration, targeting, training, monitoring, materials, users, and so forth. On impact size, we will focus on one outcome at a time (e.g., full immunisation), but also make sure to indicate if the programme affected other outcomes. Insignificant impacts will not be included in the cost&#x02010;effectiveness analysis.</p><p>We will use Review Manager 5 to complete and submit the review, while using Stata 14 for all statistical analyses, including the metan command for meta&#x02010;analyses.</p></sec><sec id="cl21119-sec-0310"><label>3.8</label><title>Treatment of qualitative research</title><p>We will use qualitative research to supplement the findings of our quantitative synthesis. While we will not seek out all qualitative studies relating to community engagement and immunisation in LMICs, we will look for qualitative studies to provide additional information about the context and the implementation of interventions included in the quantitative synthesis. This may include feasibility studies, stakeholder analyses, formative evaluations, process evaluations, and project reports, among other documents. These sources will provide key inputs to our analysis of the facilitators and inhibitors of effective community engagement interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="cl21119-sec-0320"><title>ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</title><p>M.

This technical assistance includes, but is not limited to: reviewing study designs, analysis plans, and data collection instruments; advising research teams on how to improve study components and address challenges that arise during the course of the evaluation; and supporting grantees in engaging with stakeholders to promote uptake and use of evidence generated by the evaluations.</p><p>As members of 3ie staff, authors Monica Jain, Mark Engelbert, Marie Gaarder, and Avantika Bagai have all had varying levels of involvement in reviewing proposals for these evaluations and providing research teams with technical assistance. These SR authors therefore have a vested interest in the success and prominence of these studies, which fall under the scope of the proposed SR. This presents a conflict of interest in that the authors may apply different standards to these studies when reviewing them for inclusion in the SR or deciding how much weight to give them in the analysis.</p><p>However, there are several procedural safeguards and transparency measures in place that mitigate the risk this conflict of interest imposes. First, all candidate studies, including those funded by 3ie, will undergo a rigorous multi&#x02010;step screening process, including review at the title, abstract, and full&#x02010;text levels. To qualify for inclusion in the SR, a study must be judged to meet the inclusion criteria by two independent screeners who have reviewed the full text of the study. The screening protocol will be made publicly available, as will the protocol for analysing included studies.</p><p>Moreover, the screening for this SR will be conducted by independent consultants who, while paid by 3ie, will not be 3ie staff and will not have provided technical assistance or interacted with authors of 3ie&#x02010;funded studies. Finally, the authors will, upon request, provide full records of each round of screening, detailing the studies that were excluded and included at the title, abstract, and full&#x02010;text levels.</p><p>The authors have no financial interests in this area and have not published any prior reviews on the topic.</p></sec><sec id="cl21119-sec-0350"><title>PRELIMINARY TIMEFRAME</title><p>We plan to submit the review in or around February, 2020.</p></sec><sec id="cl21119-sec-0360"><title>PLANS FOR UPDATING THE REVIEW</title><p>Contingent on funding, this review will be updated two years after the original review is published. Monica Jain will lead the update.
