These are generally funded by the government, aid agencies, nongovernmental organizations, foundations, or firms under corporate social responsibility. Invariably, most of them require that their programs be evaluated to understand if the intervention succeeded or failed (Bamberger, <xref rid="cl21122-bib-1001" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>Public development programs have been an important component of the development policy of the Government of India. The first 5 year plan deemed that systematic evaluation should become a normal administrative practice in all spheres of public activity and for this the Planning Commission (PC) began developing the evaluation techniques by establishing Program Evaluation Organisation for independent evaluations of community projects and other intensive area development programs (Chandrasekar,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21122-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). PC of India which was later dissolved and new organization named National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) was created on January 1st, 2015. The NITI Aayog is responsible for preparing the policy framework, designing the public programs and also monitors and evaluates the outcomes achieved by different programs (NITI Aayog,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21122-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p><p>There has been and increasing trend of impact evaluations in low and middle income countries over the years. The largest share (34.4%) of studies is conducted in Sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa followed by Latin America and Caribbean with 24.7% of the total studies, while South Asia ranks third at 17%. Nearly half of South Asian studies are conducted in India (Sabet &#x00026; Brown,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21122-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Though the numbers of impact evaluations is growing there is no central repository for easy access or to identify sectors with evident gaps.</p><p>Also, in a diverse country like India implementation and flawless evaluation of all the public development programs is a great challenge. Timely evaluations of such programs are often pushed by the policy makers and the program implementers to increase the accountability and for improvement of the program (Malhotra,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21122-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite, effective measures taken by the union and state governments there are evident gaps present in evaluation of these public development programs. Identification of these gaps will help in making the programs more effective and will eventually support in improving the development indicators of the country.</p><p>Evaluations of public programs also contributes toward cost cutting and cost&#x02010;effectiveness as it gives information about what works and what does not. This is essential because of the rise in public expenditure and economy of India. Appropriate monitoring and evaluation of a program helps to identify the challenges in implementation of a particular program and provides an evidence base for decisions pertaining to public resource allocation; leading to more effective public policy development (Malhotra,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21122-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Over the past decades demand for program evaluations have increased greatly as emanating from civil society, enforced by the Supreme Court and Comptroller and Auditor General and government ministries, especially at the level of central government. Also donors, who although having a relatively small role in India, also support evaluations. Multilateral agencies (the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the United Nations system agencies) and five bilateral donors present in India (the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan) support evaluation of programs to which they make a financial contribution.</p><p>In an effort to align the &#x0201c;Strategy for New India&#x0201d; with India's commitment to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), NITI Ayog with extensive consultations and inputs published &#x0201c;Strategy for New India @ 75.&#x0201d; It has identified 41 different areas that require either a sharper focus on implementing the flagship schemes already in place or a new design and initiative to achieve India's true potential.</p></sec><sec id="cl21122-sec-0030"><label>1.2</label><title>Scope of the evaluation map</title><p>The proposed country evidence and gap map will include all published impact evaluations of development interventions implemented in India from 2000 to 2018. Development is broadly defined to cover all interventions intended to either directly or indirectly improve the well&#x02010;being of the people of India. Technical studies (e.g., clinical trials of new drugs or testing new agricultural inputs) are excluded, though efficacy and effectiveness evaluations of the adoption and use of these technologies under field conditions are included.</p></sec><sec id="cl21122-sec-0040"><label>1.3</label><title>Why it is important to develop the evaluation map</title><p>There are close to 400 impact evaluations identified in India through initial search of international initiative for impact evaluations (3ie). But what we do not know is the spread of these impact evaluations across the intervention sectors and SDG. Several important questions have not been adequately addressed. For example, what type of evidence is needed, and what are realistic expectations for outcomes and effectiveness research? Knowledge production takes place across several sectors (health, social welfare, and education), focuses on various populations (different ages, ethnicities, or with different needs), and involves rather diverse methodical approaches (e.g., systematic reviews, primary studies of different designs, etc.).</p><p>A mapping of the existing knowledge base is therefore required to provide a comprehensive overview of existing knowledge in this area and enable the purposeful and targeted commissioning of future evaluations, tailored to the most eminent needs for knowledge and guidance. This ambition could be fulfilled by proposed Evidence and Gap Maps (EGM).</p></sec><sec id="cl21122-sec-0050"><label>1.4</label><title>Existing EGMs and/or relevant systematic reviews</title><p>To our knowledge this will be the first country evaluation map for development impact evaluations for India. Though similar maps are ongoing in Uganda and Kenya.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="objectives" id="cl21122-sec-0060"><label>2</label><title>OBJECTIVES</title><p>The primary objective of the India country evaluation map is to make the existing impact evaluations accessible to the users, and to support evidence&#x02010;informed decision&#x02010;making across government, development partners, and civil society.</p><p>Secondary objectives are to

</p><p>The research question being addressed to support these objectives is: what is the extent of the evidence base of Impact evaluations of development programs in India?</p></sec><sec id="cl21122-sec-0070"><label>3</label><title>METHODOLOGY</title><sec id="cl21122-sec-0080"><label>3.1</label><title>Defining country evaluation maps</title><p>Saran and White (<xref rid="cl21122-bib-1004" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) defined EGMs as &#x0201c;a systematic visual presentation of the availability of relevant evidence of effects for a particular policy domain.&#x0201d; The evidence is identified by a search following a prespecified, published search protocol. The map may be accompanied by a descriptive report to summarize the evidence for stakeholders such as researchers, research commissioners, policy makers, and practitioners. Evidence and gap maps summarize what evidence there is, not what the evidence says.&#x0201d;</p><p>Similar to EGMs, country evaluation maps systematically search for relevant systematic reviews and impact evaluations based on a prespecified, published search protocol, and provide graphical representation of available evidence. The scope of country evaluation map, however, is larger than typical EGM as the former will include all policy domains that will affect the welfare of the people of the country, and include only Impact evaluations.</p></sec><sec id="cl21122-sec-0090"><label>3.2</label><title>Evaluation map framework</title><p>The framework has been developed through the following process:</p><p>Stage 1: Initial framework is constructed through consultation of strategy and policy documents as identified from NITI Ayog strategic goals for a new India by 2022.</p><p>Stage 2: Piloting of the framework with 10&#x02013;20 included studies. The framework was finalized based on pilot coding of 10&#x02013;20 studies. Any subsequent changes to the framework will be recorded as deviations from protocol.</p></sec><sec id="cl21122-sec-0100"><label>3.3</label><title>Population</title><p>The relevant population for this map is both the people (including refugees) and institutions of India.
