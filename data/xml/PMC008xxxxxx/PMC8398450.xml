Introduction</title><p>Among the various sources of water pollution with heavy metals, the rapid increase in industrialization is causing many environmental problems day by day [<xref rid="B1-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Water pollution has reached a point of threatening human and aquatic life. Heavy metals accumulate in living organisms because of their toxicity and non-biodegradability [<xref rid="B2-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, they can cause a lot of acute and chronic diseases. The treatment of industrial wastewater including heavy metals is becoming an important subject for improving water quality. Cd (II), Cr (III), Cu (II), Fe (III), Mn (II), and Ni (II) are considered as some of the most toxic metals for living organisms when their concentration exceeds the required limits [<xref rid="B4-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Increased chromium exposure leads to cancer, asthma, and diarrhea. Physiological deficiency is caused by liver disease, kidney complications, and a brain defect [<xref rid="B5-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The presence of iron in wastewater above the tolerable level can cause intestinal damage and respiratory tract irritation [<xref rid="B7-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, the contamination of water with Mn (II)/Fe (III) ions leads to poor water taste, odour, colour, and turbidity; Mn (II)/Fe (III) water pollution also causes many chronic diseases [<xref rid="B8-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Chemical precipitation, flotation, reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, electrochemical precipitation, ion exchange, chemical oxidation, adsorption, and other conventional treatment methods are generally used to remove heavy metals from wastewater [<xref rid="B9-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Most of the mentioned techniques have ingrained restrictions, such as low efficiency, the generation of significant quantities of sludge, and costly disposal, except adsorption [<xref rid="B9-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Adsorption is the most preferred among the mentioned treatment technologies for extracting heavy metals from wastewater because of its efficiency [<xref rid="B10-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It provides design flexibility, and the treated effluents are of high quality, are reversible, and absorbent materials can be regenerated [<xref rid="B11-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Among the substances used to remove metal ions from contaminated water by adsorption are alumina, silica, activated carbon, graphene oxide, manganese oxides, ferric oxide nanoparticles, polyaniline, titanium oxides, and zinc oxide [<xref rid="B13-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Lately, scientists have focused on preparing new multifunctional adsorbents with low costs and ease of use [<xref rid="B16-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These adsorbents may be composed of synthetic or natural substrates, such as industrial byproducts, clays, biosorbents, and modified biosorbents [<xref rid="B18-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Among these substrates, chitosan (natural biopolymers) [<xref rid="B20-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] is considered an effective adsorbent for removing heavy metals [<xref rid="B21-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] because it is a polysaccharide with the functional groups -OH and -NH<sub>2</sub>, is hydrophilic and biodegradable, and is easy to derive because of its ability to form chelates with the heavy metals [<xref rid="B22-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, it is known for its mechanical weakness, [<xref rid="B23-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] its ability to dissolve in an acidic medium, and its capability of leaching carbohydrates if utilized in its raw structure [<xref rid="B25-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, several adsorbents, including &#x0201c;magnetic&#x0201d; nanoparticles and chitosan, have been prepared and have shown their excellent efficiency for heavy metal removal from wastewater [<xref rid="B26-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Magnetic adsorbents are considered alternative adsorbents because of their fascinating properties, i.e., high adsorption performance and magnetic characteristics, facilitating their separation by applying an external magnet [<xref rid="B28-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Magnetic gamma iron oxide (&#x003b3; ferric oxide Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is one of the iron oxides which has a high magnetic field compared to the other three iron oxides, i.e., Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (iron (II, III) oxide) and FeO (iron (II) oxide) [<xref rid="B30-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. When &#x003b3; Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (ferric oxide) is embedded with natural polymers, it gives a high potential nanocomposite that can be used in many fields such as medicine and water treatment due to its high ability to adsorb organic and inorganic pollutants [<xref rid="B32-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Based on the above-mentioned concerns, this paper focused on searching for low cost-effective adsorbents and eco-friendly methods to treat wastewater from inorganic effluent (heavy metals) [<xref rid="B33-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Herein, chitosan extract was abstracted for shrimps [<xref rid="B34-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A novel adsorbent quaternary nanocomposite, chitosan/grafted halloysitenanotubes@Zn&#x003b3;magnetite (Ch/g-HNTs@ZnM), was synthesized via the ultrasonic-assisted adhesion technique to adsorb the Cr (III), Fe (III), and Mn (II) from wastewater. The characteristics of chitin (chitosan extract), halloysite, Zn@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and the synthesized Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M quaternary nanocomposite were revealed by several techniques, including FTIR, SEM, XRD, GPC, TGA, TEM, and surface zeta potential. Batch processes with the synthesized Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M were investigated. Generally, adsorption via the continuous column process is the most promising method for the future wastewater treatment implementations of existing adsorbents. The various factors affecting the metal ion removal efficacy on the Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M adsorbent were studied. The effects of solution pH, metal ions&#x02019; initial concentration, temperature, quaternary adsorbent dosage, and contact time were investigated for batch adsorption. Additionally, nonlinear regression was designed for various kinetic and equilibrium models to evaluate the adsorption data.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-polymers-13-02714"><title>2.

After removing their legs and heads, the shells were well rinsed repeatedly with tap water, followed by their drying at 70 &#x000b0;C and grinding into fine powder [<xref rid="B35-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Chitosan (Ch) was then extracted from the shrimp shell powder according to Hosny et al., 2014 [<xref rid="B20-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. First, the deproteinization process was performed by adding 0.1 N NaOH solution to the shrimp shells with continuous stirring for two days to remove proteins, filtration of the produced solution at 25 &#x000b0;C, and washing the filter with distilled water to the pH of 7. Second, the demineralization process was carried out by stirring the resulting filter for 8 continuous days in 200 mL of a 3&#x02013;5% hydrochloric acid solution, then filtering and washing to eliminate the minerals and obtain pure chitin. Finally, the deacetylation was achieved by hydrolyzing the produced chitin in 50% NaOH and stirring for 4 h at a fixed temperature of 40 or 90 &#x000b0;C, followed by washing the filter with water at 50 &#x000b0;C while stirring for 5 h to produce pure chitosan at a pH of 7.

Synthesis of a Novel Chitosan/Grafted Halloysite@Zn&#x003b3;Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Tetra-Nanocomposite (Ch/g-HA@Zn&#x003b3;M)</title><p>The ultrasonic-assisted adhesion method was used to synthesize the Chitosan/grafted Halloysite@Zn&#x003b3;Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> tetra-nanocomposite (Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M) because it diminishes the time of crystallization and forms more consistent nuclei. Briefly, in the first step, the ultrasonic dispersion method was applied for 30 min at 25 &#x000b0;C on a mixture solution containing 0.5 g Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub> and 0.862 g (3 mmoL) Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;6H<sub>2</sub>O, and dissolved in 30 mL of ethanol and containing Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;6H<sub>2</sub>O. 0.862 g (3 mmoL).

The prepared chitosan molecular weight and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of chitosan and Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M nanocomposite were determined by the GPC analysis.

The broad FTIR bands that appeared in the range of 3000&#x02013;3500 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are correlated to the stretching vibration of O&#x02013;H.

The Fe-O absorption band of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> appeared at a lower wavenumber than the Zn&#x003b3;Fe3O4 sample., possibly because of the electrostatic strength between the surface and the halloysite of Zn&#x003b3;Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. A Fe-O absorption band was still in the magnetic halloysite chitosan, which suggested using an electrostatic activity to cover the Zn&#x003b3;Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> particles of halloysite in the magnetic composite.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot3-polymers-13-02714"><title>3.1.3. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)</title><p>The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for chitosan, halloysite, and Zn@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> material provide clear insights into their structural characteristics. The XRD pattern of chitosan shows distinct peaks at 2&#x003b8; = 9.24&#x000b0; and 17.5&#x000b0;, which correspond to the (010) and (020) diffraction planes. These peaks confirm the semi-crystalline nature of chitosan, with broadening indicating the transformation from the crystalline structure of chitin to the more amorphous structure of chitosan.

It can be observed that chitosan has an irregular diameter in the range of 14.6&#x02013;37.6 &#x000b5;m with cracks and pores on its surface, and the number of pores increased significantly, as illustrated in Hosny, 2014 [<xref rid="B41-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Consequently, it can be concluded that chitosan has pores and cracks in its surface more than chitin; this gives chitosan a high ability to adsorb heavy metals more than chitin.</p><p>SEM images of the magnetic composite were evaluated to describe the size and morphology of these synthesized constructions.

The results estimated that the PZC for the Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M composite was pH of 10.9, indicating that the Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M particles acquire a positive charge below this pH, while, above this pH, the particles acquire a negative charge.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot9-polymers-13-02714"><title>3.1.9.

These results suggest that the Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M nanocomposites are characterized by mesoporous structures with pore sizes of 20&#x02013;30 nm. These vicissitudes in hysteresis and pore size distribution may be ascribed to the role played by chitosan in tailoring the pore structure of the nanocomposites, which stems from integrating two-dimensional (chitosan sheets) and zero-dimensional (Zn &#x003b3;Fe3O4 NPs) structures into a single material.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-polymers-13-02714"><title>3.2.

This figure reveals that the Fe (III) removal % was increased by increasing the ion concentrations until 40 mg/L, corresponding to 99.06% removal efficiency then decreasing to 93.3% at 60 mg/L. The high ability of Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M to adsorb Fe (III) may be due to that chitosan is a versatile polymer and has reactive (NH<sub>2</sub> and-OH) groups on its backbone, which leads to a variety of applications and characteristics [<xref rid="B42-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-polymers-13-02714" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

The adsorption effect of Cr (III), Fe (III), and Mn (II) ions onto Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M was studied in the pH range of 3.0&#x02013;10.0 while maintaining the initial concentrations of the mentioned ions at 20 mg/L and the adsorbent Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M dose at 2 g in 100 mL of solution at 30 &#x000b0;C. The effect of pH versus the percentage of the removed metal ions is shown in <xref rid="polymers-13-02714-f012" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>. The results revealed that the removal percentage of the Cr (III) ion increased significantly with increasing the solution pH, as the highest removal percentage was 96% at the pH of 9, which could be related to the change in the surface charge distribution that significantly impacts metal ion removal. The adsorbent surface becomes positively charged at a low pH, pH = 2, because of H<sup>+</sup> ion adsorption from the acidic medium, enhancing the adsorption of the negative loaded Cr (III) ions, which presents in the form of HCrO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> at that pH.

Consequently, at the temperature of 303.15 K (30 &#x000b0;C), the maximum removal percentages understudied occurred as 95.2%, 88.15%, and 87% for Cr (III), Fe (III), and Mn (II), respectively. The decrease in process efficiency could be attributed to the modifications and shrinkage of Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M at higher temperatures, resulting in a lowering in the number of active sites. Furthermore, the adsorbed ions on the Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M surface could detach them from the surface by increasing the temperature.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot4-polymers-13-02714"><title>3.2.4.

Conclusions</title><p>In this paper, a novel Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M magnetic quaternary nanocomposite was fabricated to remove the ions of Cr (III), Fe (III), and Mn (II)) from wastewater. Its characteristics were investigated utilizing FTIR, SEM, XRD, GPC, TGA, TEM, and surface zeta potential. Adsorption investigations were carried out at various conditions to determine their effects on the adsorption process and obtain the isotherms of reaction. The maximum removal % of Cr (III), Fe (III), and Mn (II) on the Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M adsorbent reached 95.2%, 99.06%, and 87.1% at 40 mg/L of ion concentrations. The optimum removal for all studied metal ions was obtained at a pH of 9.0 and a contact time of 60 min, which were utilized for equilibrium removal. The thermodynamic study of adsorption was with negative values of &#x00394;H&#x000b0;, &#x00394;G&#x000b0;, and positive value of &#x00394;S&#x000b0; indicates an exothermic, spontaneous, and chemical adsorption. For isotherm and kinetic modelling, the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order models were better fitted the experimental data.</p><p>Additionally, upon completion of the adsorption process in contaminated water, the magnetic properties of the synthesized tetra-nanocomposite represent an advantage for recovering its particles. Thus, the current study suggests the Ch/g-HNTs@ZnM tetra- nanocomposite as a highly efficient, promising, and green alternative source adsorbent in the wastewater treatment concept. Furthermore, by using Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M for Cr (III), Fe (III), and Mn (II) adsorption, the environmental load, and effect of Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M will be reduced, and so the impact of Ch/g-HNTs@Zn&#x003b3;M will via an environmentally friendly method.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to the Dean of Science and Research at King Khalid University to make financial support available and thankful to the Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute for making the practical analysis.
