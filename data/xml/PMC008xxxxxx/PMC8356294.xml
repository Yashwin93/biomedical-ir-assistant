Millions more are poorly nourished and in many parts of the world, the quality of education remains poor. Children are at risk from multiple violations of their rights, including child labour, early marriage, and sexual exploitation. Research plays a crucial role in helping to close the remaining gaps in child well&#x02010;being, yet the global evidence base for interventions to meet these challenges is mostly weak, scattered and often unusable by policymakers and practitioners. This mega&#x02010;map encourages the generation and use of rigorous evidence on effective ways to improve child well&#x02010;being for policy and programming.</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0020"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of this mega&#x02010;map is to identify, map and provide an overview of the existing evidence synthesis on the interventions aimed at improving child well&#x02010;being in low&#x02010; and middle&#x02010;income countries (LMICs).</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0030"><title>Methods</title><p>Campbell evidence and gap maps (EGMs) are based on a review of existing mapping standards (Saran &#x00026; White, 2018) which drew in particular of the approach developed by 3ie (Snilstveit, Vojtkova, Bhavsar, &#x00026; Gaarder,&#x000a0;2013). As defined in the Campbell EGM guidance paper; &#x0201c;Mega&#x02010;map is a map of evidence synthesis, that is, systematic reviews, and does not include primary studies&#x0201d; (Campbell Collaboration, 2020). The mega&#x02010;map on child well&#x02010;being includes studies with participants aged 0&#x02013;18 years, conducted in LMICs, and published from year 2000 onwards. The search followed strict inclusion criteria for interventions and outcomes in the domains of health, education, social work and welfare, social protection, environmental health, water supply and sanitation (WASH) and governance. Critical appraisal of included systematic reviews was conducted using &#x0201c;A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews&#x0201d;&#x02010;AMSTAR&#x02010;2 rating scale (Shea, et al., 2017).</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0040"><title>Results</title><p>We identified 333 systematic reviews and 23 EGMs. The number of studies being published has increased year&#x02010;on&#x02010;year since 2000. However, the distribution of studies across World Bank regions, intervention and outcome categories are uneven. Most systematic reviews examine interventions pertaining to traditional areas of health and education. Systematic reviews in these traditional areas are also the most funded. There is limited evidence in social work and social protection. About 69% (231) of the reviews are assessed to be of low and medium quality. There are evidence gaps with respect to key vulnerable populations, including children with disabilities and those who belong to minority groups.</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0050"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although an increasing number of systematic reviews addressing child well&#x02010;being topics are being published, some clear gaps in the evidence remain in terms of quality of reviews and some interventions and outcome areas. The clear gap is the small number of reviews focusing explicitly on either equity or programmes for disadvantaged groups and those who are discriminated against.</p></sec></abstract><counts><fig-count count="19"/><table-count count="8"/><page-count count="44"/><word-count count="0"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>December 2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:30.09.2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type="self-citation">

Education (83) and social protection (62) are fairly well&#x02010;represented. However, there is limited evidence synthesis in nontraditional areas: social work and welfare (44), environmental health including WASH (41) and governance (13).</p><p>The most commonly studied outcomes are health (259) and healthy development (215).

The degree to which this is achieved can be measured in terms of positive child outcomes, whereas negative outcomes and deprivation point to the neglect of children's rights (Bradshaw, Hoelscher, &#x00026; Richardson,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21116-bib-0408" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Monitoring, protecting and promoting well&#x02010;being is central to realisation of children's rights, as set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, (UNICEF, Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989)</p><p>According to UNICEF's &#x0201c;State of the World's Children&#x0201d; report (Keeley &#x00026; Little,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21116-bib-0422" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), there are 2.2 billion people aged under the age 18 and under and the majority of these are living in poverty. Evidence from countries across the globe shows that children who grow up in poverty are more likely to experience poor health, fewer opportunities to access good quality education and to be low paid or unemployed in the future (Keeley &#x00026; Little,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21116-bib-0422" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Children living in extremely poor households are unevenly concentrated in certain parts of the developing world. Sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa has the highest rates of children living in extreme poverty at just under 49%, and South Asia has the second highest share at nearly 36% (UNICEF and the World Bank Group, 2016).</p><p>Research plays a crucial role in helping to close the remaining gaps in child well&#x02010;being, yet the global evidence base for effective interventions to meet these challenges is mostly weak, scattered and often unusable by policymakers and practitioners.

The map is a table or matrix which provides a visual presentation of the evidence. In the present map, the rows are intervention categories and the columns are indicator (outcome) categories. This mega&#x02010;map provides an overview of all available evidence (systematic reviews and EGMs) till December 2018 on the key outcome domains and interventions aimed at improving child and adolescent well&#x02010;being in LMIC countries using an intervention&#x02010;outcome framework.</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0180"><label>2.4</label><title>Method</title><p>The mega&#x02010;map was developed in stages:</p><p>Framework construction:</p><p>The first step was to decide the scope of the mega&#x02010;map. Specifically, it involved identifying the primary dimensions of the map, that is, interventions and outcomes. We started developing the draft framework by reviewing UNICEF strategic plan documents (UNICEF,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21116-bib-0387" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). We also reviewed key documents by major funders in this sector such as WHO, UNDP, Department for International Development (DFID) and the World Bank. An expert group comprised of international experts in the field was formed. In consultation with the expert group, intervention and outcome categories were reviewed and modified and the scope was set. The map was discussed with stakeholders in two consultation meetings and the framework further refined.</p><p>Search Methodology:</p><p>Step 1: Included a search of relevant systematic reviews and EGMs from the 3ie database. This initial map included 99 studies.</p><p>Stage 2: A full database search was performed. The search was carried out on (a) Systematic Review databases, such as 3ie and Campbell Collaboration databases (full list is provided in the appendix) (b) Academic databases, such as OVID and Embase. This identified 302 relevant systematic reviews after the full database search.</p><p>Stage 3: (a) Additional websites were searched for grey literature, including those of bilateral and multilateral organisations, such as ILO and UNDP; websites of J&#x02010;PAL and ANU&#x02010;Lib. (b) Experts consulted, and (c) screened and coded studies received from key informants. This phase identified additional 54 studies for inclusion.</p><p>The search of the full academic databases and grey literature yielded 9,086 hits and 356 studies were included in the final map after screening and coding.</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0190"><label>2.5</label><title>Selection criteria</title><p>The primary population of interest for this map is children and adolescents from LMICs (UNICEF, Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989). Children irrespective of their sex in the age group of 18 years and under were included in the EGM. The age group is classified based on the age criteria stated as follows: infanthood (&#x0003c;3 years of age), childhood (3&#x02013;10 years), adolescence (10&#x02013;18 years). The population subgroup of interest includes: girls, orphans and vulnerable children, children with disabilities, children belonging to ethnic minorities, child sex workers, child brides, isolated children/street children, children with HIV/AIDS, migrants and children affected by conflict and humanitarian crises.</p><p>Systematic reviews are often global in scope. Systematic reviews were included if the &#x0201c;inclusion criteria&#x0201d; in the reviews was to include studies from LMICs unrelated to the fact that weather studies from LMICs were actually identified through search or included from screening. The screening process for mega&#x02010;map did not check whether the reviews included studies from LMICs. Studies with multiple populations are included in the map if they included an intervention for child well&#x02010;being.</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0200"><label>2.6</label><title>Screening, data extraction and critical appraisal</title><p>Title and abstract screening and the evidence classification were undertaken by two independent reviewers, and any discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. The studies that passed on to full text stage were screened against the eligibility criterias by two independent reviewers and conflicts resolved by a third reviewer.</p><p>After screening, all studies were coded for a wide array of information and populated into the map. The studies were coded for bibliographic details, the interventions and outcomes and other relevant aspects such as population, region and countries. The coding was again carried out by two independent reviewers and conflicts were reconciled by a third reviewer. Critical appraisal appraisal of all included studies was performed by independent reviewers.</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0210"><label>2.7</label><title>Results</title><p>The mega&#x02010;map includes 333 systematic reviews and 23 EGMs. A main finding from the map is that there is a substantial amount of evidence in the traditional areas such as early childhood development, health and nutrition and education. However, there is uneven distribution of evidence across region, quality of studies and intervention and outcome subcategories.</p><p>For example, though health and nutrition were the most populated areas of the map, some gaps were identified; management of severe acute malnutrition (8), agricultural intervention/biofortification (13), m&#x02010;health intervention for child health (16). In education, there is limited evidence around remedial education, nonformal education and scholarships and systemic intervention. In terms of quality, about 26% (58) of the systematic reviews were identified to be of low quality for health and nutrition. This was found to be similar for early childhood development (30%) and education (22%).</p><p>Striking gaps in evidence were identified in the nontraditional areas such as social protection and social welfare, with lack of evidence in many areas such as child trafficking, substance abuse prevention, interventions for child abuse, social insurance and labour market insurance. These were not just under&#x02010;researched but also under&#x02010;funded. The most funded systematic review areas have been health and nutrition and early childhood development over the years.

There are limited systematic reviews focusing on gender and equity issues in child well&#x02010;being.

A decent level of child well&#x02010;being is underpinned by the UN convention of Rights of the Child which states that &#x0201c;The child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth&#x0201d; (UNICEF, Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989). But many children around the world still suffer deficiencies in many dimensions of well&#x02010;being.</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0260"><label>3.1.2</label><title>Aspects of shortfalls in child well&#x02010;being</title><p>According to UNICEF's &#x0201c;State of the World's Children&#x0201d; report (2017), there are 2.2 billion people aged under the age of 18 and the majority of these are living in poverty. Evidence from many countries shows that children who grow up in poverty are more likely to experience poor health, fewer opportunities to access good quality education and to be low paid or unemployed in the future (UNICEF&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21116-bib-0391" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). One in three children (200 million globally) fails to reach their full physical, cognitive, psychological and/or socioemotional potential due to poverty, poor health and nutrition, insufficient care, stimulation and other risk factors related to early childhood development (Grantham&#x02010;McGregor, et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21116-bib-0409" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). It is estimated that globally, almost 385 million children are living in extreme poverty. Poverty, malnutrition, poor health, unstimulating home environments and violence against children are major risk factors, which detrimentally affect the cognitive, motor and social&#x02010;emotional development of children (Tran, Luchters, &#x00026; Fisher,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21116-bib-0417" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Children living in extremely poor households are unevenly concentrated in certain parts of the developing world. Sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa has the highest rates of children living in extreme poverty at just under 49%, and South Asia has the second highest share at nearly 36% (UNICEF, Ending extreme poverty: a focus on children. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Rich Countries, 2016). In 2017, the under&#x02010;five mortality rate in low&#x02010;income countries was 69 deaths per 1,000 live births&#x02014;around 14 times the average rate in high&#x02010;income countries (five deaths per 1,000 live births). Preterm birth complications, acute respiratory infections, intrapartum&#x02010;related complications, congenital anomalies and diarrhoea are the main factors continuing causes of high numbers of under&#x02010;five deaths (WHO, 2019). Globally, millions of adolescents die or become sick from preventable causes such as road accidents, HIV, suicides and interpersonal violence (WHO,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21116-bib-0401" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Further adding to the plight of children in developing countries, young girls and adolescent women are invariably subjected to various forms of harmful practices including child marriage and female genital mutilation. Education offers children a path to a promising future but about 264 million children and adolescents around the world fail to enter or complete school (UNESCO, 2017). These figures are alarming in 24 conflict&#x02010;affected regions with approximately 27 million children out of school (UNICEF, Goal Area 2 Every child learns&#x02010;Global annual report, 2018). They are thwarted by poverty, discrimination, armed conflict, emergencies and the effects of climate change. Often the family and environmental risk factors a child experiences are beyond their control. However, the effects of these factors can be moderated and this is where opportunities to promote children's well&#x02010;being and positive mental health lie.</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0270"><label>3.1.3</label><title>Consequences of shortfalls in child well&#x02010;being</title><p>Childhood deprivation cannot just take childhood from children, but also have long&#x02010;run consequences. Child undernutrition is associated with shorter adult height, less schooling, reduced economic productivity and lower offspring birthweight for women (Victoria et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21116-bib-0418" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Lack of education is a major factor in households remaining poor (Baulch,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21116-bib-0421" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Early marriage is bad for the health of the mother&#x02014;with greater risk of dying during childbirth&#x02014;and her offspring who are at greater risk of having low birth weight and of dying prematurely (Nour,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21116-bib-0419" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0280"><label>3.1.4</label><title>Addressing shortfalls in child well&#x02010;being</title><p>The provision of services on health, education and safety to all children in the world irrespective of cast, creed, colour and ethnicity is a fundamental right enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNICEF, Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989).</p><p>In recognition of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, children's rights and well&#x02010;being are acknowledged as important for long&#x02010;term sustainable development of children. Many SDGs are important reference points for the design of national development strategies for child well&#x02010;being including: End poverty (SDG1), End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture (SDG2), health (SDG3), quality education (SDG4), reduce inequality between and within countries (SDG10). Despite this apparent focus on child well&#x02010;being and various international organisations working towards a common goal, striking gaps remain in achieving SDG's.</p><p>Research plays a crucial role in helping to close the remaining gaps in the global evidence base for effective interventions. SDG 17 targets 17.16 and 17.18 emphasise the increased need for investment in generating sound evidence to improve child well&#x02010;being intervention strategies. Though child well&#x02010;being interventions have been underway for decades; evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions is often scattered, the value is possibly underestimated and inclusion in national strategies and programmes is rare. Failure to effectively implement evidence&#x02010;informed interventions represents a key obstacle in the progress of child well&#x02010;being in many LMICs towards achieving the SDG's. This is partly due to a weak evidence base that does not give policy makers and programme managers the information needed to make decisions. Both international and national organisations should work together to fill the gaps in evidence and to gain a better understanding of what works and what does not in child well&#x02010;being.</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0290"><label>3.1.5</label><title>The intervention</title><p>The included interventions cover all main strategies to improve child well&#x02010;being outcomes.

As evidence&#x02010;informed policymaking is seen to be of increasing importance, many agencies commission systematic reviews to inform policy, but due to lack of a central global repository, systematic reviews are often duplicated. Furthermore, they sometimes lack in quality to clearly and correctly inform policy and the existing evidence base around child well&#x02010;being has major gaps. Evidence maps are an approach to providing an overview of the available evidence, with various approaches adopted to evidence mapping by different agencies over the years (Saran &#x00026; White, 2018). Since this map has such a broad scope&#x02014;all of child well&#x02010;being&#x02014;we label it as a mega&#x02010;map and map only systematic reviews and EGMs.</p><p>The mega&#x02010;map provides an overview of all available evidence syntheses on the key outcome domains and interventions aimed at improving child well&#x02010;being in LMICs using an intervention&#x02010;outcome framework. It helps to identify areas in which there are good bodies of synthesised knowledge to inform policy, and those areas in which there is little or no evidence synthesis. The map can help inform the identification of priority areas where evidence synthesis is currently lacking, such as rigorous studies of the effectiveness of early marriage interventions, child labour or the status of children in conflict&#x02010;affected situations. This will help create a central repository of all the available resources on the effectiveness of child well&#x02010;being.</p><p>UNICEF's Office of Research&#x02010;Innocenti, in collaboration with the Campbell Collaboration has published a set of five research briefs based around UNICEF's five strategic goal areas and highlighting the main findings from the mega&#x02010;map as well as remaining evidence gaps.

A crucial step is successful advocacy and social mobilisation. We assume that advocacy is one of the keys to setting priorities and improving policies to leverage child well&#x02010;being outcomes. Additionally, social mobilisation can help engage a broad range of actors so that they become involved in driving change, by raising awareness and by creating the demand for better policies, services and accountability. Both these components together help identify different target population and creating a demand and supply for better policies and services. Child well&#x02010;being encompasses numerous domains such as early child development, health and nutrition, education, social work and welfare, social protection and WASH and the interventions targeting each of them are represented in the conceptual framework. Following adoption of these interventions, several outcomes are then expected to improve such as on health, education, social, economic and equity. Since UNICEF's work is structured around five overarching areas of well&#x02010;being for every child who is grounded in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, improvement in any of these child well&#x02010;being outcomes, will directly or indirectly effect fulfilment of UNICEF's goals.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="Figure" id="cl21116-fig-0001"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Conceptual framework of mega&#x02010;map.<named-content content-type="attribution">

The 3ie education EGM (which is included in the mega&#x02010;map) gives a more detailed picture showing low numbers of primary studies for scholarships and user fees, information interventions and remedial education, as well as a lack of studies for many teacher and cognitive outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0970"><title>Social work and welfare</title><p>Social work and welfare in LMICs is an under&#x02010;researched area in child well&#x02010;being. There is a lack of studies on child trafficking, early marriage, FGM and child labour. There was also limited evidence relating to child abuse and neglect as well as impact of birth registration. As a follow up to this map, UNICEF has commissioned Campbell Collaboration to undertake a map of Violence Against Children (Pundir, Saran, White, Adona, &#x00026; Subrahmanian,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21116-bib-0413" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p><p>There were no studies identified highlighting the impact of birth registration on child safety and well&#x02010;being.</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0980"><title>Social protection</title><p>Social protection is well covered because of the amount of reviews on conditional cash transfers, but there is a lack of evidence on social insurance and labour market insurance. Micro insurance programmes offer a financially sustainable model of social protection so more understanding of their effectiveness is important to inform policy.</p></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-0990"><title>Risk factors and waSH</title><p>Child injuries are an important area for which there are few reviews. There are also no reviews of safe places to play and traffic calming despite the fact that over 90% of traffic fatalities are in developing countries. There is a new ongoing map on road safety, from which preliminary findings show over 90% of evidence comes from North America. So primary studies of traffic safety measures in LMICs are an important gap.</p><p>There are no or few studies to help identify effective strategies to reduce the exposure of children to indoor and outdoor air pollution, to reduce the risk of accidents including road&#x02010;related accidents, or to reduce risk of exposure to toxic materials.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-1000"><label>9.3</label><title>Limitations of the EGM</title><p>The search strategy was systematic but owing to the large scope of the map, there are limitations. Some studies may have been missed, although several steps were taken to reduce this risk. For example, the search was conducted across a wide range of academic databases and the search was validated by an expert; reference and citation checking was undertaken and key donor websites were searched to identify grey literature. However, hand&#x02010;searching of literature was not undertaken.</p><p>Although we used a consultative process that included two roundtable events to develop the framework, experts did not fully agree on all the categories. For example, there were comments that child protection services and interventions for child abuse should be a single category. Similarly, child right interventions were not fully agreed on. We worked based on the definitions we had, which could have led to judgement bias for some studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="cl21116-sec-1010"><label>10</label><title>AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS</title><sec id="cl21116-sec-1020"><label>10.1</label><title>Implications for research</title><p>The mega&#x02010;map demonstrates major gaps in our understanding, suggesting many practices in the promotion of child well&#x02010;being are largely unsupported by evidence.</p><p>The mega&#x02010;map is the first step in identifying priority areas for rigorous systematic reviews and EGMs on child well&#x02010;being interventions. Based on the findings, a systematic research prioritisation should now be undertaken. As an immediate development from the mega&#x02010;map, UNICEF&#x02010;Innocenti and Campbell Collaboration are now working on an EGM on ending violence against children in low and middle income countries (Pundir et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="cl21116-bib-0413" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). A similar collaboration is now needed in all the areas of weak evidence synthesis to help improve and advance research.
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>&#x027a2;</label><p>There were gaps in reviews with explicit focus on equity however, there may be review of reviews that contain relevant evidence, but mapping that requires diving into the review contents in more detail. A next step could be to produce an equity&#x02010;focused version of the mega&#x02010;map which allows identification of which reviews present evidence disaggregated for priority groups.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x027a2;</label><p>It would be useful for global and country partners to work together to achieve consensus on priority areas for evidence synthesis and to adopt a coordinated approach to undertaking and updating maps and reviews across priority areas.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x027a2;</label><p>Efforts are also needed to identify optimal study design, key interventions and outcome areas so that a universal evidence base can be built and used.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x027a2;</label><p>There were a few dated systematic reviews that were identified and these need updating.
