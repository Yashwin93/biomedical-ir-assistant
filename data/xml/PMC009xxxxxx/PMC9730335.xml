However, less stable than nuclear, first marriage families due to the presence of risk factors such as the absence of social norms and the presence of stepchildren. Stepfamilies have unique educational needs regarding stepparenting and co-parenting issues. The development and documentation of psychoeducational intervention strategies can facilitate dissemination of ongoing studies and promote transparency. This article describes the background, design and protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the eficacy and feasibility of a web-based Psychoeducational Simulation Game (<italic>GSteps</italic>). Behavior-modeling video training (BMT) is used to demonstrate and promote relational skills, stepparenting and co-parenting effective strategies for adults in stepfamilies. A mental health professional will be available within the <italic>GSteps</italic> platform for clarification or emotional support.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A RCT design is presented to evaluate the outcomes of a self-administered, interactive and web-based psychoeducational Game targeting dyadic marital adjustment and interpersonal skills as the primary outcomes and remarriage beliefs, family function and stepparenting and co-parenting attitudes as the secondary outcomes. Other outcome measures include satisfaction with <italic>GSteps</italic>, participants&#x02019; knowledge learned after the intervention and a purposive sampling method will be used to access feasibility. The minimum required sample size is 112 participants (56 per condition) randomly allocated either to an experimental group (EG), receiving <italic>GSteps</italic> intervention, or to a wait-list control group (CG). A survey is conducted electronically. Assessments take place at baseline (<italic>T<sub>0</sub></italic>), after the intervention (<italic>T<sub>1</sub></italic>) and 1-month follow-up (<italic>T<sub>2</sub></italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This protocol presents a RCT aimed at evaluating the efficacy of a web-based psychoeducational intervention (<italic>GSteps</italic>) designed for improving marital, stepparenting and co-parenting skills in adults who live in stepfamilies. The use of the protocol and results of intervention studies may guide the use and refinement of web-based psychoeducational intervention for stepfamilies. Additionally, <italic>GSteps</italic> may become a tool for health professionals to enhance stepfamily functioning, stepparenting skills, and marital adjustment of remarried adults.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>remarriage</kwd><kwd>stepfamilies</kwd><kwd>web-based intervention</kwd><kwd>psychoeducational game</kwd><kwd>behavior modeling</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>study protocol</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="81"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="8180"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec4"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="sec5"><title>Background</title><p>Remarriage has been characterized as a <italic>phenomenon</italic> since the 1960s (<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">Schlesinger, 1968</xref>). Although the rate of remarriages has been declining steadily in recent decades for both men and women (<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer, 2019</xref>), cohabitation has become an increasingly common lifestyle choice. A growing proportion of cohabiting unions are second unions that form stepfamilies when there are stepchildren (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Manning, 2015</xref>). Between 2007 and 2016, the rate of unmarried stepcouples in cohabitation increased by 29% (<xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">Stepler, 2017</xref>). This trend has been observed both in America and in European countries (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Higgins et al., 2020</xref>), reflecting the increasing social acceptability of unmarried couples and families (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Guzzo, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although the literature identifies differences between remarried unions and cohabiting unions (e.g., <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Brown, 2006</xref>), both are less stable than nuclear, first marriage families (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Cherlin, 2017</xref>). This instability has been explained by the absence of social norms about the functioning of families with stepchildren (<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Nock, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Kelly and Ganong, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Coleman et al., 2022</xref>). Nuclear families have socially prescribed norms and expectations (e.g., the parent role is clear within any biological family) that &#x0201c;institutionalizes&#x0201d; their family form. The absence of social norms, the ambiguity of roles and functions of stepfamily members (remarried and cohabiting) means that these families are not completely institutionalized (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Cherlin, 1978</xref>) and contribute to a negative impact on stepfamily dynamics and marital relationship (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Garneau and Pasley, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Other factors can also contribute to the instability of stepfamilies. For example, stepcouples have to simultaneously deal with the tasks related to couple formation and parenting, often with children in different developmental stages (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Dupuis, 2007</xref>). Although much has been investigated about the intertwinement between stepcouples&#x02019; functioning and stepfamily functioning (e.g., <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Papernow, 2013</xref>), intervention programs designed for stepcouples are relatively scarce (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Adler-Baeder and Higginbotham, 2004</xref>). Those available are mostly focused on stepparenting issues and use traditional education formats, with a facilitator moderating multiple group sessions (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Nicholson et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Effective interventions to enhance stepcouples&#x02019; dynamics should address not only factors that are unique to stepparenting, but also factors that are inherent to the couple dyad (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Halford et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Adler-Baeder and Higginbotham, 2004</xref>). In common with other couple types, couples in stepfamilies may consider programs that promote general relationship skills such as communication training (e.g., <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Ahrari et al., 2020</xref>), problem-solving (e.g., <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Babcock et al., 2013</xref>), empathy skills (e.g., <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adler-Baeder, 2007</xref>), conflict and stress management and building friendship and affection (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Gottman, 1999</xref>). But for educational programs targeting stepcouples, it is important to consider their unique challenges. First, remarried people often face unrealistic thoughts around the notion that &#x0201c;the new partner should be perfect and better than previous one&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Higginbotham and Adler-Baeder, 2008a</xref>). Second, it is frequent to carry unresolved emotional patterns from previous marriage(s) to remarriage, such as feelings of guilty, betrayal or loss (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Fredericson and Handlon, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Faber, 2004</xref>). Third, after a previous marital dissolution, remarried partners feel social pressure to succeed (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Fredericson and Handlon, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein, 2000</xref>). Fourth, besides social pressure, the social network has to be rebuilt and there is a tendency to perceive lower levels of social support (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Bradbury et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Ganong and Coleman, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Dainton, 2019</xref>). Fifth, the management of financial resources can be connected to, or dependent on, the economic decisions of former partners (e.g., complying with child support; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Ganong and Coleman, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The interaction between parenting, co-parenting and stepparenting (with potential spillover effects in the quality of the relationship) should be considered when designing a program for stepcouples. Previous research has shown that the presence of unrealistic myths or expectations (e.g., &#x0201c;instant love&#x0201d; between stepparent and stepchild; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Higginbotham and Agee, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">Santos et al., 2022</xref>), may strain stepfamilies. Overall, these myths are based on nuclear family ideology, where love is usually an automatic and unquestioned feeling (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Ganong and Coleman, 2017</xref>). On the other hand, the myth that stepparents and stepchildren can never learn to love each other can lead to other difficulties in building a positive relationship (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Coleman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Ganong and Coleman, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Difficulties in roles definition and early imposition of discipline actions in the stepchild&#x02019;s rearing can also contribute to unhealthy relationships (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Papernow, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adler-Baeder, 2007</xref>). Thus, to develop a healthy stepparenting, it is recommended that couples (1) developing realistic expectations (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Fine and Kurdek, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Higginbotham and Adler-Baeder, 2008b</xref>); (2) empathize by validating stepchildren&#x02019;s feelings and emotions (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adler-Baeder, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Agulhas and Anci&#x000e3;es, 2018</xref>); (3) discuss with partner about stepparent role (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adler-Baeder, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Papernow, 2013</xref>); (4) engage in cooperative parenting instead of trying to &#x0201c;replace&#x0201d; the non-residential parent (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adler-Baeder, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Dupuis, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Papernow, 2013</xref>); (5) recognize that the ex-spouse will always be part of stepfamily (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Papernow, 2013</xref>); (6) utilize healthy co-parenting practices between ex-spouses protecting children from the details of divorce process (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Pringle and Ehrenberg, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adler-Baeder, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Pringle, 2008</xref>), parental conflict and loyalty conflicts (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Papernow, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adler-Baeder, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Agulhas and Anci&#x000e3;es, 2018</xref>). These practices minimize children&#x02019;s rejection behaviors; enhance positive stepfamily functioning; promote the construction of a unique stepfamily identity through the emotional connection of stepfamily members and increase marital quality and satisfaction (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Papernow, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Adler-Baeder and Higginbotham, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adler-Baeder, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Gelatt et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Developing a theory-based online educational game for promoting relational skills in stepcouples</title><p>Some non-traditional efforts have piloted ways to help stepcouples prevent marital and family difficulties (e.g., online intervention; telehealth; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Braithwaite and Fincham, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Gelatt et al., 2010</xref>). Web-based self-administered interventions with a behavior-modeling training (BMT) approach (i.e., visual demonstrations of behaviors) appear to increase self-efficacy and motivation (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Cairncross and Mannion, 2001</xref>). BMT promote preparation for practice by visualizing the performance of certain behavior (<xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>). This approach is based on Bandura and Walters&#x02019; social-learning theory and has been shown to be effective in producing sustainable skill improvement and behavior change with video modelling in parenting intervention programs (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Glang et al., 2007</xref>). According to that theory, human thought and behavior are influenced not only by real experience but also by direct observation. <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Bandura and Walters (1977)</xref> also concluded that learning is most effective when people observe the consequences of engaging in a specific behavior. Combined with interactive teaching aids, BMT allows individuals to access to learning environments to &#x02018;practice&#x02019; problem-solving skills and critical thinking in a virtual simulation that replicates real-life problematic situations (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Homanova et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, there is evidence that self-administrated web-based programs can be more effective than face-to-face group sessions (<xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Department of Education, 2009</xref>). <xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al. (2005)</xref> conducted a meta-analysis of 117 studies of adult training programs and concluded that BMT was effective in producing sustainable skill improvement and post-training behavior change. Attempts to include technology&#x02019; advances to differentiate the training modalities have been increasing, especially due to the pandemic situation, but randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies that investigate stepfamily outcomes remain limited (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Gelatt et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Prevention and psychoeducational programs for stepfamilies generally provided positive effects (<xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">Whitton et al., 2008</xref>). A meta-analysis of 14 studies conducted by <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Lucier-Greer and Adler-Baeder (2012)</xref> concluded that education programs for stepcouples had large effects in parenting and family functioning. <italic>Smart Steps Program</italic> (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Higginbotham and Adler-Baeder, 2008b</xref>) was one of the education programs evaluated by these authors. They concluded that <italic>Smart Steps</italic> increased relationship skills, stability, and commitment for stepparents and these improvements endured 1&#x02009;month after the study. Clinical programs for stepfamilies have also shown similar positive results. Behavioral family intervention (<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Nicholson and Sanders, 1999</xref>) or emotionally focused family therapy (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Furrow and Palmer, 2007</xref>) were two different interventional approaches that demonstrated greater reductions in couple conflict over parenting practices and promote stability, cohesion and attachment in the developing stepfamily system.</p><p>The web-based, interactive training programs for couples in stepfamilies (e.g., <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Parent et al., 2019</xref>), in particular those using BMT (<xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr">Trone, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Gelatt et al., 2010</xref>) have also demonstrated promising results. Specifically, <xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr">Trone (2002)</xref> reported higher levels of family adjustment in families with a stepfather after the intervention. <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Gelatt et al. (2010)</xref> documented significant effects in stepparenting, stepfamily, and couple domains, with both parents and stepparents increasing their skills. However, these benefits should be interpreted with caution as several limitations were noted, including the lack of random assignment, control-group, and pre-, post-, and follow-up assessments (e.g., <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Parent et al., 2019</xref>). These available web-based programs are self-administered (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Gelatt et al., 2010</xref>) and do not provide background support from health professionals (e.g., psychologist; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Gelatt et al., 2010</xref>). Besides that, these programs also do not address the many unrealistic expectations so common in stepfamilies that contribute to high levels of marital and parental dysfunction (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Higginbotham and Adler-Baeder, 2008a</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Higginbotham and Agee, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, to the authors&#x02019; knowledge, no intervention tools (traditional or web-based) have yet been developed for Portuguese stepfamilies.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Aims</title><p>To fill the gaps in the literature, our protocol intends to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a new web-based psychoeducational intervention (<italic>GSteps</italic>).

Factors unique to stepfamilies (e.g., stepparent-stepchild relationships) as well as factors that are common to all couples (e.g., communication skills) were used to build the <italic>GSteps</italic> intervention components. A total of 15 components were considered and incorporated into three content areas/modules: <italic>Conjugality</italic> &#x02013; <italic>Module 1</italic> (emotional divorce, financial issues, positive communication skills, enhance the social support network, remarriage unrealistic beliefs, stress management strategies and conflict management strategies). <italic>Stepparenting &#x02013; Module 2</italic> (positive stepparent-stepchild relationships, development of relationships within stepfamily, stepparenting roles definition, stepfamily&#x02019; unrealistic beliefs, loyalty binds related to stepparents and develop share meaning); <italic>Co-parenting &#x02013; Module 3</italic> (positive co-parenting strategies and loyalty binds related to co-parents).

These three characters were voluntarily represented by three actors from <italic>Teatro Amador de Sandim</italic> and gave us your written consent to record and release your image. Prior to dramatization, a spoken reflection was made separately including four volunteer target users: two interviewees (a stepmother and a stepfather) lived in a simple stepfamily (only one adult bring children from past relationships) and other two (a mother and a stepfather) lived in a complex stepfamily (both adults bring children from past relationships). We will collect feedback from subjects in different conditions (simple and complex) because the roles that they assume within the stepfamily are also different. In other words, in complex stepfamilies, both members of couple are simultaneously a parent (from their own children) and a stepparent (from partner&#x02019; children); but in simple stepfamilies the men and the women never have these two roles simultaneously.</p><p>Based on pilot feedback from the two major types of stepfamilies, changes in characters&#x02019; speeches, facial and body expressions were made to clarify the meaning of the content and dramatization. Before watching the videos, participants access the Game&#x02019;s objectives and learn about the technical features. After that, the three actors present themselves as members of the stepfamily and their previous families&#x02019; history (e.g., stepfather is divorced and does not have kids). This information helps the participant to know the context of the presented family&#x02019;s life cycle.</p><p>Each module lasts between 10 and 20&#x02009;min. Each is presented in a sequential video dramatization with some or all family members portraying relationship challenges (components). Videos freeze to ask participants which would be the better option in the face of a given conflict. Participants are able to see how their chosen option could play out. There are <italic>right</italic>, <italic>wrong</italic>, and <italic>not the best</italic> options, and a message pops up with a psychoeducational content focusing on positive and successful practices of stepparenting, co-parenting and remarital functioning to guide the participant to the right answer. All videos have subtitles to facilitate participants&#x02019; comprehension. For example, in module 2, the participant will see an argument between Maria and her stepfather on what Maria said &#x02013; <italic>You are not my father! Do not order me!</italic> Then, the video freezes and a question pops up &#x02013; <italic>What would be Antonio&#x02019;s best answer?</italic> The participant will have three options &#x02013; (1) <italic>Punish Maria</italic>; (2) <italic>Ask Maria&#x02019;s mother for help</italic>; (3) <italic>Explain to Maria what is his role within the stepfamily</italic> and (4) <italic>Watch the video again</italic>. If the participant chooses option one (wrong option), he/she will see a video with Ant&#x000f3;nio punishing Maria and Maria denying him authority. Then, the video freezes and a psychoeducational massage will appear &#x02013; <italic>initially, discipline and authority must be imposed by the biological parent; Maria and Ant&#x000f3;nio have not yet developed a trust relationship, because of that, she has difficulties in recognizing his authority</italic>.

This is a program that focuses on adults in stepfamilies, a vulnerable and understudied group, namely in the Portuguese context. This protocol underlines the importance of adapting psychoeducational intervention programs to the current demands of everyday life, namely, the exponential use of technological and virtual resources. Furthermore, literature suggest that online interactive multimedia programs can offer effective delivery of general education content (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Cairncross and Mannion, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Gelatt et al., 2010</xref>). As with other web-based interventions, this approach has a brief format, is low-cost and has a broad reach. The existence of subtitles in all videos enhances this reach and makes it possible to adapt the <italic>GSteps</italic> to other languages. Furthermore, it is a very comfortable type of intervention in which participants can receive the intervention from computer-devices in their own homes.</p><p>Moreover, by performing repeated measurements of psychosocial variables related with marital domain (dyadic marital adjustment; marital social skills; remarriage beliefs), parenting domain (SAB and CAB) and family functioning through a longitudinal and RCT design, this research protocol facilitates more reliable data on the outcome effects of the intervention. There are also some limitations of the protocol. All included measurement instruments are self-reports that can lead to a response-set tendency. Nonetheless, the majority of instruments are standardized inventories with good levels of reliability and validity or instruments that are tailor-made for the protocol. An expected limitation is the dropout rate during the intervention process as well as a significant missing data to follow-up assessment. To minimize this limitation, participants should be regularly notified by email to continue/end the <italic>GSteps</italic> or to participate in the post-and follow-up assessments.</p><sec id="sec29"><title>Dissemination</title><p>The use of this protocol could lead to publishable results in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
