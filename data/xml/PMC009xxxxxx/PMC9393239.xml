Recently, Nanofiber membranes are showing increasing attention in the biomedical field due to their good biocompatibility, mechanical stability, and the ability to work as a drug carrier to achieve localized and sustained drug delivery. Herein, a multifunction nanofiber membrane loaded with vitamin D (Vit D) and curcumin (Cur) was successfully fabricated using electrospinning technology. In addition, we innovatively modified Vit D with PEG to improve the hydrophilicity of PCL nanofibers. The vitro results of CCK-8, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and mineralization demonstrated that the PCL/Vit D-Cur membrane had great potential for enhancing the proliferation/differentiation of osteoblasts. Moreover, the synergistic effect of Vit D-Cur loaded PCL nanofiber membrane showed a superior ability to improve the anti-inflammatory activity through M2 polarization. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> results confirmed that the defect treated with PCL/Vit D-Cur nanofiber membrane was filled with the newly formed bone after 1&#x000a0;month. These results indicate that the Vit D/Cur loaded membrane can be applied for potential bone regeneration therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>electrospinning</kwd><kwd>vitamin D</kwd><kwd>curcumin</kwd><kwd>anti-inflammatory</kwd><kwd>bone regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The National Natural Science Foundation of China-funded this work (81701016), Zhejiang Provincial Science and Technology Project for Public Welfare (LGF20H140002), Medical Health Science and Technology Project of Zhejiang Provincial Health Commission (2020KY657), Wenzhou Public Welfare Science and Technology Project (H20210007), and Scientific and technological innovation activity plan for college students in Zhejiang Province (new talent plan) (2021R413057).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>1 Introduction</title><p>Various materials have been used for bone replacements to repair human skeleton defects and abnormalities (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Critchley et al., 2020</xref>). To effectively repair bone defects and abnormalities, scaffolds play an important role in bone support and regeneration by acting as templates for host cells (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bisht et al., 2021</xref>). A good scaffold must be biodegradable, biocompatible, and have similar functions to extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Asghari et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, electrospinning has been utilized to fabricate fibrous scaffolds for biomedical purposes since these electrospinning scaffolds allow the creation of three-dimensional structures similar to that of natural ECM (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Rahmati et al., 2021</xref>). The size and structure of electrospinning scaffolds can be controlled by adjusting the characteristics of the solution and operating conditions. Cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation can be greatly enhanced due to the high surface area to volume of electrospinning scaffolds (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Zanutto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Shokrani et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to the biomaterials used, electrospinning techniques are also used in various materials, including synthetic and natural polymers (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Puertas-Bartolom&#x000e9; et al., 2021</xref>). Many of them have been used in different biomedical applications, including poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly lactic acid (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL), dextran, aniline (AN), chitosan, chitin, silk fibroin (SF), alginate, and fibrinogen (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Nilforoushzadeh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Nourbakhsh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Rahmati et al., 2021</xref>). A common synthetic hydrophobic biodegradable polymer that takes a long time to break down in the human body is known as polycarprolactone (PCL) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Heydari et al., 2017</xref>). Several studies have shown that the slow degradation rate makes it useful for a time-controlled release of medications over an extended period of time (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Castro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Vonbrunn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Al-Baadani et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, it has been used mainly as a long-term implant material for drug release (especially hydrophilic drugs) and supports bone formation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Al-Bishari et al., 2021</xref>). It has come to our understanding that vitamin D (Vit D) plays a major role in maintaining bone mineral density in the human body. The inadequacy of Vit D levels in the body can increase the risk of bone-related problems, such as fractures and osteoporosis (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Lips and Van Schoor, 2011</xref>). In the elderly, osteoporosis and its related fractures are becoming more prevalent, associated with decreased levels of Vit D (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, according to previous studies, Vit D correlates with periodontal tissue health. For instance, the risk of bone-related periodontal diseases decreases when an optimum level of Vit D is present. The role of this naturally synthesized essential nutrient is to modulate bone mineralization for bone density maintenance. Therefore, regulating Vit D levels using external applications is vital to prevent and mitigate bone-related diseases (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">de Sire et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Levkovitz et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In complimentary to Vit D, curcumin (Cur, bis-1,7-[4-hydroxy-3-]-hepta-1,6-dione) is a natural, synthetic yellow polyphenol compound extracted from the genus Curcuma (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gunes et al., 2016</xref>). Cur is also well known for its anti-inflammatory, wound healing, anti-fungal, antibacterial, anti-tumor and antioxidant properties (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abu-Taweel and Rudayni, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2022</xref>). The <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/o-methoxyphenol" ext-link-type="uri">o-methoxyphenol</ext-link> group and the methylenic <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Hydrogen" ext-link-type="uri">hydrogen</ext-link> found in Cur are responsible for their antioxidant properties. Cur also plays a role in the bone remodeling process by targeting the NF-&#x003ba;B protein complex, inhibiting the degradation and phosphorylation of NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor protein (I&#x003ba;B) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Iddir et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Kheiridoost et al., 2022</xref>). The suppression of the NF-&#x003ba;B protein promotes osteoblast differentiation and inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, Liang et al. have proved that Cur can reduce the production of CCL3 chemokine in osteoclastic precursors (OCPs), which is responsible for stimulating RANK-independent osteoclastogenesis in bone and bone marrow cells (BMCs) (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Lorenzo, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). According to another study, Cur can also decrease the IL-1&#x003b1; induced expression of RANKL in BMSCs, leading to the suppression of osteclastogenesis and inducing apoptosis of osteoclasts (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Ozaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bharti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Sahebkar et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, some studies have confirmed the relationship between curcumin and Vit D. The effectiveness of curcumin in improving Vit D deficiency, especially in women with PMS and dysmenorrhea (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Arabnezhad et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we have utilized the electrospinning method to fabricate a nanofibrous scaffold doped with Vit D and Cur, as shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. This method of slow-release administration will result in fewer side effects and more effective drug delivery. Moreover, the study will investigate the osteogenic effects via dual-delivery of vitamin D and curcumin on post-surgical bone defect.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Graph of scaffold fabrication and use for enhancing the anti-inflammatory and bone formation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>: <bold>(A)</bold> PCL, <bold>(B)</bold> PCL/Vit D, <bold>(C)</bold> PCL/Cur, and <bold>(D)</bold> PCL/Vit D-Cur.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fbioe-10-975431-g001" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2 Material and method</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1 Preparation of Vit D/Cur loaded electrospinning scaffolds</title><p>Briefly, 1&#x000a0;g of PCL (Mn: 70,000 - 90,000) was dissolved in 10 mL of 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol solution.

The PCL and Vit D/Cur solution were then fully mixed in a volume ratio of 10:1 for the subsequent electrospinning. Four kinds of PCL scaffolds loaded with/without Vit D, Cur or Vit D/Cur (named as PCL, PCL/Vit D, PCL/Cur, PCL/Vit D-Cur) were fabricated under the conditions of 16.5&#x02013;17&#x000a0;kV and 1&#x000a0;ml/h flow rate. The collector was covered with a piece of aluminum foil. The distance between the tip of the needle and the collector was about 10&#x000a0;cm.

As shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, there was no significant change in the morphology of fibers produced from PCL, PCL/Vit D, PCL/Cur and PCL/Vit D-Cur scaffolds. All scaffolds were properly linked fibers. The PCL and PCL/Cur electrospinning nanofiber scaffolds were hydrophobic (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Within 10 s, the contact angle of PCL was 124.4&#x000b0;, and of PCL/Cur was 127.3&#x000b0;. In addition, Vit D was considered hydrophobic, but PEG modification significantly enhanced its hydrophilicity, resulting in a water contact angle of 14.1&#x000b0; for PCL/Vit D membrane at 10&#x000a0;s. Additionally, when Vit D and Cur were co-doped with PCL fibers, the corresponding PCL/Vit D-Cur samples also showed good hydrophilicity (about 12.2&#x000b0;), which is very important for bone repair materials. The FTIR data of <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> were measured using KBr pellet method, and the spectra of Cur are downloaded from the Chemistry Database (Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry of CAS., <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.organchem.csdb.cn/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.organchem.csdb.cn</ext-link>). As shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, the PCL, PCL/Vit D, PCL/Cur, and PCL/Vit D-Cur scaffolds exhibit similar adsorption features. The peak at 2,940 and 2,860&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of CH<sub>2</sub>, and the peaks at 1723&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are assigned to the C=O stretching vibration. The peaks at 1,622 and 1,583&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> can be attributed to the C=C stretching vibration of the aromatic ring, indicating the successful loading of Cur into the PCL scaffold. However, since the chemical structure of PEG-Vit D is consistent with that of PCL, their FTIR spectra are almost identical. XRD was used to detect the crystalline structures of various scaffolds. As shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, there is no obvious trend in the overall crystallinity of PCL nanofibers loaded with Vit-D and Cur molecules. However, compared to PCL, the decrease of the peak at 12&#x02013;17&#x000b0; and the increase of the (110) peak (2&#x003b8; = 21.2&#x000b0;) and (110) peak (2&#x003b8; = 22&#x000b0;) of PCL/Vit-D, PCL/Cur and PCL/Vit D-Cur scaffold suggested an increase in crystalline perfection. This indicated that Cur and Vit D were successfully incorporated into the PCL scaffold and had a weak effect on the crystallization of the PCL scaffold. In addition, the characteristic peak appeared at around 8.6 and 17.3&#x000b0;, confirming the presence of Cur in the PCL/Cur and PCL/Vit D-Cur groups (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ching et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>

The rapid advancements in material science and biotechnology through accessible support materials make the bone tissue scaffolds continuously evolve to enhance cell adhesion and proliferation, promoting bone regeneration by continuously releasing bio-molecules (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Alonzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>).

Moreover, the binding of Vit D to the PEG and combining with Cur on one scaffold enhanced its hydrophilicity.

Recently, several investigations have confirmed the importance of Vit D action in the osseointegration process, and they suggest that the deficiency of Vit D negatively affects bone regeneration, and the osseointegration of implants might be impaired (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dvorak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). It is proved that an inadequate serum level of Vit D is also closely associated with bone mineral density (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kelly et al., 2009</xref>). During the osseointegration period, Vit D can affect the result through its effect on the immune system. According to epidemiological studies, calcitriol can affect both innate and acquired immunity by promoting macrophage function, enhancing chemotaxis and phagocytosis, and producing cytokines and other immunomodulatory peptides (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Insua et al., 2017</xref>). The association of Vit D deficiency with reduced antimicrobial activity of cells and increased risk of bacterial infections is reported by many studies. They indicate the importance of Vit D adequacy at the clinical level during osteointegration, and later graft union stages (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Javed et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the property of Cur, which has been widely studied, has no adverse effects on the human body, even when taken in large doses of 2&#x02013;12&#x000a0;g/day (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, Cur has been shown to have a significant role in osteoblast differentiation as well as in the prevention of RANKL-induced osteoclast resorption, which may explain its outstanding performance in restoring bone health (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Banez et al., 2020</xref>). Besides its anti-inflammatory properties, Cur may also have anti-inflammatory benefits via inhibiting the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hardwick et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, scaffolds loaded with Vit D and Cur represent a promising and safer alternative for treating bone defects by providing a higher local drug concentration and relieving adverse side effects or cytotoxicity to healthy cells. Our findings showed that PCL/Vit D-Cu scaffold does not exhibit any toxicity toward osteoblast and promotes its viability, proliferation, ALP activity, mineralization, and osteogenic genes expression (Runx 2, ALP, OPN, COL-1). In addition, the PCL/Vit D-Cu scaffold contributes effectively to increasing and regulating M2-related genes such as (IL-10) and (IL-1ra) processes by performing an anti-inflammatory role and producing anti-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p>Moreover, it decreases M1-related genes such as (TNF-&#x003b1;) and (IL-1&#x003b2;) respond to inflammatory signaling by performing a pro-inflammatory role, which may improve the anti-inflammatory effects and promote bone tissue regeneration. These findings verify the rapid augmentation of anti-inflammatory and osteogenesis by enhancing the bone mineral density as well as increasing the mature bone microstructure through the Vit D and Cu. In conclusion, the PCL/Vit D-Cu membrane could be a promising drug candidate for the therapy for bone tissue regeneration, which may overcome the limitation faced by current bone tissue regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>This study aimed to utilize dual drugs-loaded nanofiber membranes with the advantage of local delivery of bioactive drugs to accelerate osteogenesis. XRD and FTIR showed that Vit D and Cur were successfully incorporated into PCL nanofibers. Although Vit D and Cur had some effect on the mechanical properties of PCL, the target membrane was shown to have sufficient mechanical stability for bone repair applications. In addition, PEG-Vit D significantly improved the hydrophilicity of PCL nanofiber membranes. The surface was becoming hydrophilic and improved the biocompatibility of the PCL scaffolds and the release of Cur.</p><p>Furthermore, in vitro-related assays confirmed that the nanofibers with a prolonged release profile of Vit D/Cur had good cytocompatibility and improved cell proliferation/differentiation. In addition, the target membrane polarized more RAW264.7 cells toward alternatively activated macrophages (M2), as shown by upregulated M2 expression markers (IL-10, IL-1ra) and downregulated M1 expression markers (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;) in the cells. Also, the PCL/Vit D-Cur significantly increases the VEGF and BMP-2 expression compared to other groups.</p><p>Moreover, MC3T3-E1 cells cultured in a conditioned medium from the RAW264.7 cells showed significantly promoted ALP, Red stain, and osteogenic-related genes. Furthermore, the <italic>in vivo</italic> results demonstrated that after 1&#x000a0;month of membrane implantation in a rabbit model, the osteoinductive properties of PCL scaffold loaded Vit D/Cur significantly improved bone reformation. Hence, this study offers a simple yet successful development of scaffolds for bone regeneration.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s7"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by The Animal Ethics Committee of Wenzhou Medical University.</p></sec><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="s8"><title>Author contributions</title><p>AA-B&#x02014;Data collection&#x02014;Data analysis and interpretation&#x02014;Writing&#x02014;original editing BA-S&#x02014;Data analysis and interpretation AA-B&#x02014;Writing review draft MA-B&#x02014;validation LY&#x02014;Software JS&#x02014;Resources LC&#x02014;Investigation YS&#x02014;validation Corresponding ZD&#x02014;finding acquisition&#x02014;Conception or design of the work Corresponding PG&#x02014;Supervision&#x02014;Conception or design of the work&#x02014;Final approval of the version to be published.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s10"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Correction note</title><p>A correction has been made to this article.
