One of those efforts is the development of vaccines to prevent severe diseases that could result from these infections. Historically, vaccines are the most effective means of preventing illness and death from infectious diseases. The discovery of vaccines has led to reduced morbidity and mortality from several infectious diseases and the elimination and eradication of some [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Development of safe and effective vaccines is a huge step to the control of epidemics; however, there is the need to address vaccine hesitancy because of its potential impact on vaccine uptake. Vaccine acceptance is critical in the successful control of pandemics. Successful immunization programs have resulted in the prevention of 4&#x02013;5 million deaths among all age groups annually, making it one of the most successful and cost-effective public health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">WHO defines vaccine hesitancy as a &#x0201c;delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services.&#x0201d; The resurgence of infectious diseases in recent years can be attributed to vaccine refusals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Vaccine hesitancy are among the 10 threats to global health in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Many individuals are left unvaccinated, leaving them and others around them vulnerable to diseases. With the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccines, there is a greater potential to save millions of lives with vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the spread of vaccine misinformation and anti-information has resulted in an increase in vaccine mistrust in the US. False vaccination information is spreading rapidly through social media, causing general distrust and safety concerns, thereby worsening vaccination hesitancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and disease outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is scientific evidence that anti-vaccination activities organized via social media is predictive of the belief that vaccines are not safe and the prevalence of vaccine disinformation predicts a decrease in mean vaccination coverage over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Vaccination misinformation may have significant and lasting impacts on vaccine acceptance overall. Poor vaccination rates mean high cases of preventable illnesses, suffering, death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and huge economic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Poor vaccine coverage and the persistent high burden of vaccine-preventable diseases despite proven vaccine safety and effectiveness imply the need to identify drivers of vaccine hesitance and effective intervention strategies to reduce both among this population. Reducing the spread of false vaccine information or the proportion of people who believe them could reduce the effects of these harmful messages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As the world undertakes the largest vaccination campaign in human history to combat COVID-19 and HIV, past research on strategies for vaccine acceptance and hesitancy can inform our understanding of these issues. Lessons learned from interventions to improve measles and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake could be applied to improve uptake of COVID-19 vaccine and potential future HIV vaccine(s).</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Vaccine</title><p id="Par7">Since HIV was identified as the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1984, millions of people have been affected worldwide. HIV/AIDS incurs huge morbidity, mortality, and economic burden globally. The introduction of the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) resulted in a decrease in the public health and economic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; however, with a slower decrease in number of new cases, prevalence of the infection continues to rise. Currently, more than 36 million people are infected with HIV and more than 39 million AIDS-related deaths have occurred globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This is a major public health problem for years to come.</p><p id="Par8">There is currently no vaccine for HIV, but scientists have been working on developing one for over 30&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The challenges with producing a HIV vaccine lies in the structure and characteristics of the HIV to mutate rapidly and evade the human immune system. This means that a vaccine for one HIV subtype may prevent that specific subtype but be completely ineffective against another HIV subtype. However, extensive progress has been made. The National Institutes for Health (NIH) is investing in a safe and effective preventive HIV vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. There is evidence that an upcoming HIV vaccine trial looks promising.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>COVID-19 Vaccine</title><p id="Par9">In December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause and the disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the highest level of alarm under international law. As of May 2021, more than 160 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections and 3.5 million confirmed deaths had been recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In December 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the first Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of a vaccine to protect against COVID-19 and by February 2021, there were three authorized COVID-19 vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]&#x02014;Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson vaccines.</p><p id="Par10">Vaccination is a crucial part of ending an epidemic; therefore, widespread vaccine uptake is critical for the control of the global pandemic through vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine has the potential to save lives if its uptake is optimal. Studies show a mixed response to COVID-19 vaccine acceptance globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and even among healthcare workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A study conducted in early 2020 among adults in the United States (US) found a COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate of 67% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Current data show that as of August 2021, 70% of US adults have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]; however, there continues to be a geographic and racial/ethnic disparity in the acceptance of the vaccine, with Blacks and Hispanics having persistently low vaccination coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In low-income countries, only 1.1% have received at least one dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Poor COVID-19 vaccine coverage could have negative impacts on the efforts to control the pandemic. There is a need for public health officials and policymakers to prioritize effective strategies to promote acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines and potential HIV vaccines, especially for those who are most vulnerable. We conducted a narrative review of studies on interventions to address measles and HPV vaccine hesitancy. We discussed how these strategies could be applied towards COVID-19 and potential HIV vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Search Strategy</title><p id="Par11">We used a subset of the studies that were retrieved for a different systematic review for this review.

We also excluded systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We restricted the studies to those that mentioned either measles or HPV in the title or abstract and those that were published after 2005 when the HPV vaccine became available. Two reviewers independently reviewed the records selected for manual screening to identify final studies to include. We included 152 studies on vaccine promotion strategies with diverse contents that were implemented in different settings and targeting various populations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>PRISMA flow diagram for HPV and Measles studies</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11904_2022_622_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Study Outcomes of Interest</title><p id="Par15">The primary outcome of interest for this review was vaccine uptake with vaccine knowledge, attitudes, and intent as secondary outcomes of interest.

These include Education campaigns (providing education on vaccination, disease, and how vaccine work); On-site vaccination (providing vaccine at workplace or places of worship); Incentives (offering financial incentives for vaccination); Free vaccination (providing vaccination free of cost); Institutional recommendation (a recommendation made by the institution that person works at especially for healthcare providers); Provider recommendation (recommendation by doctor/nurse); Reminder and recall (reminders for vaccination); Message framing (gain vs loss framing of the vaccine), and Vaccine champion (institutionally appointed champion that encouraged vaccination). If more than one type of domain was employed, we classified the study as multi-component.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>HPV Vaccine Promotion</title><p id="Par17">We identified 131 articles conducted from 2006 to 2020 that discussed behavioral insights interventions to promote HPV vaccinations (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Improved awareness and knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccine were usually associated with intention to get vaccinated or actual vaccine uptake; however, some studies found non-significant difference in HPV vaccine acceptability after an educational intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Educational interventions designed to target specific populations were effective in improving vaccine knowledge and this was usually associated with improved vaccine acceptance. Parents and caregivers were more confident in HPV vaccine when they were exposed to messages that addressed lack of knowledge about the vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Some of the educational interventions targeted providers, while others targeted young adults as catch-up populations.</p><p>The second most common intervention was message framing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. This involves describing the benefits of receiving (gain-framed message) or the costs of not receiving (loss-framed message) HPV vaccine to the participants. This type of intervention was employed mainly for adults. The effect of message framing on HPV vaccine acceptance was moderated by perceived susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>] in some cases. Overall, message framing improved HPV knowledge and HPV vaccine acceptance; however, this depended on the other variables in the study and use of appropriately framed messages for target populations. Some authors found that HPV vaccination intention and uptake were not influenced by message framing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Furthermore, some authors found some types of message framing to have negative effects on vaccine acceptance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Gainforth and Latimer found that participants (women) who were exposed to high-risk information perceived HPV vaccine as having higher response cost and were less motivated to receive HPV vaccine compared to women who received low-risk information. The authors observed that this negative effect of high-risk information may be mitigated by appropriately framed messages. Increase in vaccination intentions and uptake significantly improved when messages were tailored to the target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>].</p><p>The use of financial incentives improved HPV vaccine initiation and completion in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>] and the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. Impacts were not moderated by deprivation level and decision quality was unaffected by the intervention. Offering financial incentives to the participants was associated with significant increase in both the initiation and completion of HPV vaccines series.</p><p>Free-of-charge HPV vaccine was associated with increased vaccine uptake in some settings. In a study conducted in Australia, when HPV vaccine was offered free of charge, there was a significant increase in vaccine coverage from 42.6 to 73.2% among gay and bisexual men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. In Denmark, free vaccination increased coverage for adolescent girls to 80% for dose 1, 75% for dose 2, and 62% for dose 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. High-risk participants or those who perceived themselves to be at risk were more likely to accept the free vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. On the other hand, the study in the US found that the proportion of adolescent and adult females completing three on-time HPV4 doses was 21% vs. 18% respectively.

Educational interventions focused on disease risk can be used to improve coverage of COVID-19 and a future HIV vaccine in diverse populations. Message framing is a powerful tool for vaccine promotion; however, messages should be carefully framed and should be targeted to the population of interest. Financial incentives, free-of-charge vaccines, and use of vaccine champions should be considered in future vaccine promotions as they were successful in increasing both measles and HPV vaccine coverage rates. Interventions should be context specific, be designed to target populations, and build on the challenges highlighted in various settings.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>This article is part of the Topical Collection on <italic>Global Health</italic></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Change history</bold></p><p>10/1/2025</p><p>The original version of this paper has been updated.
