Management includes immunomodulatory therapies and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). However, this cohort is particularly susceptible to the chemotherapeutic regimens and acutely affected by graft-vs-host disease (GvHD), driving poor long-term survival in transplanted patients. Autologous HSC gene therapy could offer an alternative treatment option and would abrogate the risks of alloreactivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Hematopoietic progenitor (Lin<sup>&#x02212;ve</sup>) cells from XIAP<sup>y/&#x02212;</sup> mice were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding human XIAP cDNA before transplantation into irradiated XIAP <sup>y/&#x02212;</sup> recipients. After 12&#x000a0;weeks animals were challenged with the dectin-1 ligand curdlan and recovery of innate immune function was evaluated though analysis of inflammatory cytokines, body weight, and splenomegaly.

Serum IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, and TNF were significantly reduced 2-h post-curdlan administration in non-corrected XIAP<sup>y/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to wild-type and gene-corrected animals. Appropriate reduction of inflammatory responses was observed in gene-corrected mice, whereas non-corrected mice developed an inflammatory profile 9&#x000a0;days post-curdlan challenge.

Currently, the only curative treatment option for XIAP deficiency is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In patients with severe disease, including HLH and severe refractory IBD, HSCT is often considered. However, early reports demonstrated poor transplant outcomes in this disease, with long-term survival below 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens were associated with poor long-term survival, (43% 5-year overall survival) particularly in the context of HLA-mismatched donors or ongoing HLH at time of transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. More recent reports of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens suggest these approaches are better tolerated with improved survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, HSCT is associated with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), which significantly increases the risk of mortality in patients with XIAP deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy abrogates any risk of alloreactivity due to GvHD making it an extremely attractive potential therapy. For over 20&#x000a0;years, autologous HSC gene therapy has been a promising treatment option for specific immune disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and this success continues to promote the development of new gene therapy approaches for other monogenic immune disorders including several forms of familial HLH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">XIAP is an antiapoptotic protein that regulates cell death in response to apoptotic stimuli by directly inhibiting caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 via its N-terminal baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As such, T cells from XIAP deficient patients, including invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells which express elevated levels of caspases that are inhibited by XIAP, have an increased sensitivity to activation-induced cell death (AICD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although blood lymphocyte cell numbers may be within normal ranges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], it is thought that suboptimal expansion of virus-specific T cells occurs following infection in XIAP deficient patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. XIAP is also involved in other immune signaling pathways essential for innate immune responses. The RING and BIR2 domains of XIAP are required for nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in response to activation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) and NOD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Several studies have shown that peripheral monocytes from XIAP-deficient patients have compromized cytokine production, including TNF and IL-8, in response to NOD2 ligands, while TLR-2 and TLR-4 receptor stimulation is unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Impaired NOD2 signaling is implicated in the development of IBD in XIAP deficiency. In addition, serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3;, and TNF are elevated in XIAP-deficient patients with HLH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. IL-18 levels are significantly elevated during HLH in XIAP deficiency and remain chronically elevated during remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">XIAP is known to play a role in dectin-1 signaling, a transmembrane pattern recognition receptor (PRR) involved in antifungal immunity through &#x003b2;-glucan recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The observations by Hsieh et al. demonstrate that XIAP-deficient mice have impaired innate immune responses following dectin-1 priming, which result in XIAP deficiency-like features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. XIAP is also an important regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Studies show loss of XIAP result in dysregulated caspase-1/NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which is associated with overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, XIAP prevents TNF-mediated, receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIPK3)-dependent cell death, by regulating RIPK1 ubiquitylation, and inhibiting inflammatory cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Due to the role of XIAP in preventing cell death, over-expression of XIAP can enhance cell tolerance to external and internal apoptotic stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and dysregulation of XIAP has been shown to contribute toward the progression of multiple cancers, including bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], ovarian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Therefore, the expression profile of XIAP is thought to be part of a system of regulatory loops that balance a cell&#x02019;s response to environmental stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In addition to its anti-apoptotic function, extensive studies suggests that XIAP is important for both the clearance of pathogens and the regulation of inflammatory responses.</p><p id="Par10">To address the treatment challenges in this condition, we generated a self-inactivating lentiviral vector containing human XIAP cDNA under the control of a spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) promoter, as well as a GFP reporter gene (LV-SFFV-XIAP-GFP) and investigated whether gene transfer could correct immune abnormalities and phenotype in a murine model of the disease and XIAP-deficient patient cells. Here for the first time, we show that lentiviral mediated gene correction can recover immune defects associated with XIAP deficiency, providing proof of principle for an autologous HSC gene therapy treatment approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mice</title><p id="Par11">All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee (Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London [UCL], UK) and licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (Home Office, London, United Kingdom).

There are reports describing female carriers with random X inactivation experiencing mild inflammatory symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]; however, we are encouraged that the high levels of correction (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;50%) resulted in restoration of NOD2 signaling, suggesting that this level is sufficient to provide clinically relevant benefit.</p><p id="Par32">In conclusion, the data shown here strongly supports the development of gene-correction approaches to treat patients with XIAP deficiency and overcome complications associated with HSCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="10875_2022_1389_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file 1 (DOCX 18 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="10875_2022_1389_MOESM2_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary file 2 (PDF 157 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Change history</bold></p><p>10/1/2025</p><p>In this article, the Funder ID was incorrectly listed as 'Medical Research Foundation: 10.13039/501100009187.'
