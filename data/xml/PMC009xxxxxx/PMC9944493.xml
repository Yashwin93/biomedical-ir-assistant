This situation leads to poor prediction of candidate drugs in the drug development process due to the lack of preclinical modelling for intestinal function. By using 3D bioprinting, we generated a colitis-like condition model that can evaluate the barrier function of albumin nanoencapsulated anti-inflammatory drugs. Histological characterization demonstrated the manifestation of the disease in 3D-bioprinted Caco-2 and HT-29 constructs. A comparison of proliferation rates in 2D monolayer and 3D-bioprinted models was also carried out.

Introduction</title><p>In the drug development process, systemic availability, off-target outcomes, and reduced efficacy comprise the main challenges for the successful clinical prediction of candidate drugs [<xref rid="B1-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This situation highlights the need for superior preclinical tools so that intestinal function can be modelled [<xref rid="B2-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For drug administration, oral delivery is the most common route, and in addition to absorption and metabolism, an appropriate location for specific substances, namely, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other therapeutic compounds, is directly provided by the intestine [<xref rid="B3-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It also functions as an organ for studying interactions between drugs [<xref rid="B5-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Animal models are often used to determine the toxicity and efficacy of drugs. However, species differences lead to a disparity in translating results to clinical settings [<xref rid="B7-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The major in vitro models employed to investigate intestinal bioavailability and toxicity are 2D monolayers and microsomes [<xref rid="B8-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although microsomes serve as a viable model for the initial assessment of metabolism, they are not able to model cellular-level outcomes [<xref rid="B9-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, the lack of physiological conditions in the 2D model leads to poor clinical predictions [<xref rid="B10-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Newer models using microfluidic chips enable enhancement of several physiological conditions that appear to be lacking in 2D cultures [<xref rid="B11-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite this, cell-based studies and molecular signalling experiments still remain a challenge [<xref rid="B12-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In vitro models have certain limitations that have affected the refinement of techniques involving human primary cell lines of intestinal origin [<xref rid="B13-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In contrast to cell lines, monocultures resemble actual tissues. Isolation of the epithelium from supportive cells can do two things: first, it may impair functioning; second, it may restrict the ability to have complex cell interactions, including inflammatory responses or interstitial cells [<xref rid="B14-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>When organoids were discovered, this revealed another path to modelling the intestine in vivo [<xref rid="B15-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, they may lack organ physiology in vivo due to an inward epithelium, making them inaccessible for pharmacokinetic assays such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion [<xref rid="B16-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For this reason, the creation of accessible compartments requires a complex bioreactor setup and producing a monolayer with nonphysiological transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) [<xref rid="B17-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To overcome these limitations that are evident in the existing system, a commercial bioprinting source with appropriate technology was developed for a complex three-dimensional human organ model so that it may effectively imitate the native structure and function of the organ [<xref rid="B18-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, we attempt to develop a 3D-bioprinted model for colitis to evaluate the efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs on barrier function in 2D- and 3D-bioprinted models. Cell growth in 2D monolayers allows access to the same amount of nutrients and growth factors present in the medium, leading to homogeneous growth and cellular proliferation. The key novelty of this model is its simplicity to use and efficiency. Because the major limitation of 2D cell culture methods for mimicking colitis is that they do not have any control over shape and structure, TEER measurement cannot be accurate for measuring barrier function. In our model, the control of the shapes of cells, adhesive islands, microwells, and micropillars has been customized via a 3D bioprinting method that will allow for reproducible results in terms of measurement of the epithelial barrier function.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-biomimetics-08-00041"><title>2.

Cell Lines and Culture Method</title><p>Caco-2 and HT29 colon cancer cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATTC), Manassas, VA, USA. The cell lines were allowed to grow in DMEM (Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle&#x02019;s Medium (DMEM)) and 1X glucose (Thermo Scientific Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA). This mixture also included 10% foetal bovine serum, 1% L glutamine, and 1% antibiotic solution (penicillin and streptomycin).

Cell Viability Assay to Determine Relative Proliferation in 2D Monolayer and 3D-Printed Cell Cultures</title><p>A single solution cellTiter 96<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> nonradioactive cell proliferation MTS assay kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) was used to determine the viability of both 2D- and 3D-printed cultured cells, which included treated and untreated cells. In this method, 20 &#x003bc;L of the MTS solution was prepared. This solution was then incorporated into all of the wells in the 2D monolayer. The solution was also subjected to the 3D-printed spheroid&#x02019;s culture. The set-up was then incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for a period of 3 h. Following this step that lasted 4 h, both 2D- and 3D-printed cell cultures were analysed utilizing a Flurostar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech, Aylesbury, UK). The absorbance was measured at 490 nm. The cell survival percentage in each well was estimated to compare the cellular response of Caco-2 and HT29 cells at 48 h.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-biomimetics-08-00041"><title>2.3. Three-Dimensional Bioprinting of the Colitis-Like Condition Model</title><p>The INKREDIBLE bioprinter (CELLINK, G&#x000f6;teborg, Sweden) was employed to produce cell-laden hydrogel strands in a computer-regulated environment. A 10 &#x000b5;m in-plane resolution and 100 &#x000b5;m layer resolution were employed. The equipment contained 2 pneumatic print-points. Their extrusion capability was based on, first, the pressure exerted on the piston, second, the geometry of the extrusion nozzle&#x02019;s geometry, and third, the bioink&#x02019;s rheological properties. Air was pressurized and supplied with a compressor, which was set up externally. This compressor was, however, connected to an alternate outlet. The air could be pressurized to up to 250 kPa. Multiple dials could be employed to regulate the pressure transferred to the print leads. In addition, there existed printing nozzles which possessed an inside diameter of 0.6 mm. In general, the printing pressures applied were between 20 kPa and 100 kPa (<xref rid="biomimetics-08-00041-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-biomimetics-08-00041"><title>2.4. Preparation of Cell-Loaded Hydrogels</title><p>For preparing cell-loaded hydrogels, the cells were processed individually as their specific requirements demanded. The trypsinization method served to process adherent cells (Caco-2 and HT29 cells). PBS (Gibco) solution was employed to wash the culture-flasks after attaining 90% confluence, after which a solution of trypsin EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) 0.25% (<italic toggle="yes">w</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>) was incorporated. The area ratio employed for this addition was 1 mL/1 cm<sup>2</sup> of the culture surface. After this, centrifugation was done at 500&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for a duration of 10 min. The resulting cells were then resuspended using the culture media. This step was followed by counting. Then, Caco-2 and HT29 were resuspended in 300 &#x000b5;L of the same culture medium. For uniform mixing, 3 mL of CELLINK Bioink (universal bioink) was employed for 300 &#x000b5;L of Caco-2 (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions; the remaining 3 mL of CELLINK was treated with 300 &#x000b5;L of HT-29 cells (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells). A similar method as described above was utilized. The mixing procedure resulted in obtaining 2 print-cartridges, both of which contained 3 mL of cell-loaded hydrogel: one with Caco-2 in equal proportions, and the other containing HT-29 cells. In both cartridges, the cellular density amounted to 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-biomimetics-08-00041"><title>2.5.

The findings revealed that 3D-printed cell growth was 30&#x02013;40% slower. There was a linear increase in the MTS assay signal with an increase in the initial cell population. However, this eventually attained a plateau when higher initial cell numbers were present. Cell overgrowth was contributed as the causative factor for this observation. To obtain a considerably intense signal when preventing this excess growth, we chose a high preliminary cell-seeding density (10,000 cells/well) for both Caco-2 and HT-29 cells for the experimental drug treatments.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-biomimetics-08-00041"><title>3.2.

In this study, we attempted to incorporate primary cells into a completely human 3D-bioprinted colitis-like condition model to replicate many features of physiological colon functionality in vitro. Histological studies confirmed that a colitis-like condition was evident in 3D-printed cells.</p><p>In this investigation, it was observed that the experimental method of culturing along with the culture growth environment had a significant effect in terms of the rate of proliferation. These factors were also seen to affect the rate of proliferation of the 3D cultures as related to the 2D cultures. The type of cell lines employed decided if the proliferative intensity of a 3D culture would be fast or slow when studied together with a 2D culture. There are several cell lines, as reported in published studies, that have demonstrated a slower rate of proliferation among 3D cultures in contrast to 2D cultures [<xref rid="B23-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For instance, the endometrial cancer cell lines, namely, Ishikawa (RL95-2), KLE, and EN-1078D, in a 3D reconstituted basement membrane (3D rBM) is one set of combinations among them. The other ones include the colorectal cancer cell lines Caco-2, DLD-1, HT-29, SW480, LOVO, and COLO-206F on Laminin-rich extracellular matrix (IrECM) [<xref rid="B29-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

This is a possible outcome of the formation of biopsy life. However, the values remained consistently above a physiological range. The physiological barrier function was successfully demonstrated through the TEER values in 3D-printed Caco-2 and HT-29 cells at day 10 and 15, respectively, and this was maintained through to day 21 of the culture. Furthermore, the measurement of the barrier in the 3D-printed construct model barrier measurement was consistent with the monolayer culture of adult intestinal epithelial cells as previously reported [<xref rid="B34-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, these monolayer models are typically limited to less than 11 days in-culture, can suffer from low expression of CYP similar to Caco-2 cells, and have not yet been assessed for toxicity or inflammatory response [<xref rid="B35-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>It is suggested that our data, when combined with long-term viability, indicated that the 3D-printed model has great potential to characterize other known classes of compounds that have off-target toxicity in the intestine, for example, chemotherapeutics [<xref rid="B36-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. They could help to assess and explain model chronic diseases and inflammatory pathways, for example, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn&#x02019;s disease, and colitis [<xref rid="B36-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Future applications could raise the level of complexity by incorporating additional cell types, such as cancer cells or immune cells, and utilizing healthy and diseased donor material [<xref rid="B39-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Doing so will help to better understand how each cell type contributes to the disease phenotype and better characterize candidate modulators for therapeutic intervention in disease-relevant backgrounds [<xref rid="B40-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Regarding future direction and experimental design, we will aim to use decellularized extracellular matrix-based bioinks and explore ways to incorporate vascularization of the bioprinted tissue, which will enable us to develop a more advanced version of colon tissue with better biomimetic features. Thus, this approach will allow us to understand the biomolecular pathways of inflammation resolution via novel and conventional drugs [<xref rid="B41-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-biomimetics-08-00041" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, we set out to achieve biomimicry of a fully human cells-based 3D-bioprinted colitis model with greater complexity and function compared to standard in vitro models. The 3D-printed model duplicated physiological functions and important intestinal features. It was constructed to provide a flexible platform consistent with barrier function studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Qassim University, represented by the Deanship of Scientific Research, for the financial support given to this research under the number (10166-cams1-2020-1-3-1) during the academic year 1441 AH/2020 AD.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
