have been implicated in various neurological disorders. Nonetheless, a validated
fluorine-18 labeled positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for GluN2B imaging in the
living human brain is currently lacking. As part of our PET ligand development program, we
have recently reported on the preclinical evaluation of [<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 &#x02013; a
GluN2B PET ligand with promising attributes for potential clinical translation. However,
the further development of [<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 is currently precluded by major
limitations in the radiolabeling procedure. These limitations include the use of highly
corrosive reactants and racemization during the radiosynthesis. As such, the aim of this
study was to develop a synthetic approach that allows an enantiomerically pure
radiosynthesis of (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 and
(<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1, as well as to assess their <italic toggle="yes">in
vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> performance characteristics for imaging the
GluN2B subunit-containing NMDA receptor in rodents. A two-step radiosynthesis involving
radiofluorination of the boronic acid pinacol ester, followed by coupling to the
3-benzazepine core structure via reductive amination was employed. The new synthetic
approach yielded enantiomerically pure (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 and
(<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1, while concurrently circumventing the use of
corrosive reactants. <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> autoradiograms with mouse and rat brain
sections revealed a higher selectivity of (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 over
(<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OFNB1 for GluN2B-rich brain regions. In concert
with these observations, blockade studies with commercially available GluN2B antagonist,
CP101606, showed a significant signal reduction, which was more pronounced for
(<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 than for
(<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1. Conversely, blockade experiments with sigma2
ligand, FA10, did not result in a significant reduction of tracer binding for both
enantiomers. PET imaging experiments with CD1 mice revealed a higher brain uptake and
retention for (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1, as assessed by visual
inspection and volumes of distribution from Logan graphical analyses. <italic toggle="yes">In
vivo</italic> blocking experiments with sigma2 ligand, FA10, did not result in a
significant reduction of the brain signal for both enantiomers, thus corroborating the
selectivity over sigma2 receptors. In conclusion, we have developed a novel synthetic
approach that is suitable for upscale to human use and allows the enantiomerically pure
radiosynthesis of (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 and
(<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1. While both enantiomers were selective over
sigma2 receptors <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>,
(<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 showed superior GluN2B subunit specificity

channels that belong to the family of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). Endowed with
a remarkable variety of biological functions, NMDA receptors constitute heterotetrameric
complexes composed of combinations of the subunits GluN1, which is processed in eight
distinct splice variants, GluN2A-D, and GluN3A-B.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Typically, a functional
NMDA receptor comprises two glycinebinding GluN1 subunits and at least one glutamate-binding
GluN2 subunit. Simultaneous binding of glycine and glutamate initiates NMDA receptor
activation, which involves voltagedependent relief of magnesium blockade, depolarization of
the postsynaptic membrane and calcium ion influx.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> While NMDA receptors are
key players in neurophysiology, contributing to memory and learning via modulation of
synaptic plasticity, the GluN2B subunit-carrying NMDA receptor has been implicated in the
pathophysiology of various neurological disorders.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Indeed, the role of
overstimulation of the excitatory GluN2B subunit in the development of several CNS-related
pathologies has been corroborated,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> whereas targeting GluN2B-mediated
excitotoxicity has been suggested as a promising therapeutic strategy for various diseases,
including Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD), Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD), ischemic stroke,
traumatic brain injury, neuropathic pain and depression.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Early efforts to
develop NMDA receptor antagonists prompted the discovery of NMDA receptor channel blockers
such as phencyclidine (PCP), thienylcyclohexylpiperidine (TCP), ketamine, memantine, and
MK-801 (dizocilpine). Despite their well-documented therapeutic effi cacy, most of these
&#x0201c;broad-spectrum&#x0201d; antagonists were associated with a poor safety profile,
potentially owing to the lack of subunit-selectivity.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> As such, more recent attempts have focused on the development of
GluN2B-selective antagonists, which has become feasible since the discovery of the
<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-terminal domain (NTD) binding site that is located at the interface
between GluN1 and GluN2B.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Several
GluN2B-selective antagonists have been reported to date &#x02013; some of which have been
advanced to humans, including CP101,606 (traxoprodil)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, MK-0657 (CERC-301)<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>
and EVT-101 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01128452" ext-link-type="uri">NCT01128452</ext-link>).
Nonetheless, the development of a suitable GluN2B-selective antagonist for clinical use has
proven challenging, at least in part, due to the lack of appropriate non-invasive imaging
tools that allow the assessment of target engagement in the human brain.</p><p id="P3">Positron emission tomography (PET) constitutes a powerful non-invasive molecular
imaging modality that allows real-time quantification of biochemical processes.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Accordingly, PET has been established as a
reliable tool for CNS-targeted receptor quantification as well as target occupancy studies
in preclinical and clinical research.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>
Given the translational relevance of visualizing drug-receptor interactions to facilitate
the development of GluN2B antagonists in the pipeline, strenuous efforts have been devoted
to the discovery of a suitable GluN2B PET radioligand in the past two decades. While
numerous probes exhibited high <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> specificity and selectivity towards
the GluN2B subunit, the vast majority of reported ligands were plagued by unfavourable
<italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> performance characteristics.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Major drawbacks included low brain penetration, lack of <italic toggle="yes">in
vivo</italic> specificity and selectivity, as well as the presence of radiometabolites in
the CNS.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> We have recently reported on the first successful GluN2B
subunit-selective PET radioligand, (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>11</sup>C]Me-NB1, that proved
to be suitable for visualizing GluN2B <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in
vivo</italic>.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> The structure of
(<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>11</sup>C]Me-NB1 belongs to a class of 3-benzazepine based
ligands, encompassing a series of high-affi nity GluN2B antagonists, that were first
reported by Tewes et al.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Of note,
(<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>11</sup>C]Me-NB1 was successfully translated to humans,
rendering it the first and only GluN2B-targeted PET radioligand to be clinically validated
to date.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Despite the outstanding
performance characteristics, the use of (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>11</sup>C]Me-NB1 is
limited by the short physical half-life of carbon11 (20.3 min), which confines the use of
(<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>11</sup>C]Me-NB1 to facilities with an on-site cyclotron. As
part of our efforts to develop a suitable radiofluorinated analog (physical half-life of
fluorine-18, 109.8 min), that would allow satellite distribution to hospitals without an
on-site cyclotron, we have synthesized and evaluated a series of fluorinated
(<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>11</sup>C]Me-NB1 derivatives<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>
&#x02013; of which [<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 proved to be particularly promising for translation
into humans. However, the clinical translation of [<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 requires further
optimization of the radiolabeling strategy. In particular, current radiolabeling routes
utilize corrosive reactants such as boron tribromide and lead to racemization of
enantiomerically pure precursors. However, based on previous observations with this class of
compounds<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, it is anticipated that
(<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)- and (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 may exhibit distinct
enantiomeric behaviors with respect to GluN2B binding specificity and selectivity over sigma
receptors. Along this line of reasoning, a synthetic approach that allows the
enantiomerically pure synthesis of (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 and
(<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 without racemization is warranted to enable
the evaluation of the enantiomers in future human studies. Thus, the aim of this study was
to develop a synthesis strategy that is devoid of corrosive reactants and provides
enantiomerically pure (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 and
(<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 suitable for human use, as well as to assess
their <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> performance characteristics for
imaging the GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor in rodents.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results And Discussion</title><p id="P4">While [<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 exhibited outstanding performance characteristics as a
GluN2B subunittargeted PET radioligand in preclinical experiments, the original
radiosynthesis was plagued by the harsh conditions required to cleave the hydroxyl
protecting groups, hampering automatization and clinical translation of the probe (Scheme 1,
previous work).<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Moreover, when employing
enantiomerically pure precursor <bold>1</bold>, racemization of the center of chirality in
benzyl position was observed during the reaction with boron tribromide, precluding the
synthesis of enantiomerically pure (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)- or
(<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1.<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> We have now developed a novel synthesis strategy (Scheme 1, this work)
that proceeds via a building block approach, thereby opening up several possibilities: (1)
precursor <bold>3</bold> for the radiosynthesis does not contain any OH-groups, which
alleviated the necessity of protection groups for the radiofluorination. (2) Starting from
enantiomerically pure 3-benzazepine building block 5 allowed us to conduct radiolabeling of
enantiomerically pure of (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1 and
(<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-[<sup>18</sup>F]OF-NB1. (3) Additionally, the novel strategy was
faster and more effective compared to the linear two-step synthesis, since a chiral HPLC to
separate the enantiomers at the end of the radiosynthesis was no longer required. (4)
Finally, given the rapid nature of reductive aminations, our proposed building block
approach is adoptable to a wide scope of substrates, including those containing functional
groups that are not tolerated under nucleophilic radiofluorination conditions.</p><p id="P5">The concept of building block-based radiochemistry is well established in
fluorine-18 chemistry for a variety of reactions<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>, including reductive
alkylations with fluorinated benzaldehyde,<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> however, this is the first successful example of a radiosynthesis that
leverages a radiofluorinated aliphatic aldehyde intermediate for subsequent reductive
alkylation. The reductive alkylation reaction is chemoselective towards amines over
alcohols, as opposed to nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl halide, where overalkylation
of tertiary amines and alkylation of alcohols typically occur as side reactions. Boronic
acid pinacol ester <bold>3</bold> was used as precursor for the radiosynthesis, as the
copper-mediated radiofluorination of arylboronic esters constitutes a reliable and versatile
labeling strategy.<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> Arylboronic esters as
precursors can be readily obtained by Miyaura-borylation of aryl halides in one
step.<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> In contrast to other
established radio-precursors, oxidative conditions are not required (cf. diaryliodonium
salts or iodonium ylides).<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> Another advantage of copper-mediated radiofluorination
of boronic acid esters is that regioselectivity issues during fluorine-18 incorporation are
not typically observed, as opposed to the radiofluorination of diaryliodonium
salts.<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">Boronic acid pinacol ester <bold>3</bold> (Scheme 1), which served as precursor for
the radiolabeling, was obtained in a multistep synthesis, starting from commercially
available 1iodo2halobenzenes <bold>6a&#x02013;c</bold>. A Heck reaction<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> with but-3-en-1-ol, followed by isomerization,<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>
gave aldehydes <bold>7a&#x02013;c</bold> in variable yields and purity (Scheme 2). Indeed,
only in the case of 1,2diidodobenzene, the reaction led to pure 4(2iodophenyl)butanal
(<bold>7a</bold>). In sharp contrast, the bromo and fluoro analogues, <bold>6b</bold> and
<bold>6c</bold>, yielded inseparable mixtures of 4(2halophenyl)butanal (<bold>7b</bold>
and <bold>7c</bold>) and undesired regioisomers 3(2haloophenyl)butanal (<bold>8b</bold> and
<bold>8c</bold>, 10&#x02013;11 %, from <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra analysis). Thus, despite
the low yeld of 11 %, the synthesis was continued with <bold>7a</bold>. Aldehyde
<bold>7c</bold> was used as a non-radioactive reference for HPLC method development.</p><p id="P7">Protection of the aldehyde as an acetal (<bold>9</bold>)<sup><xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> was necessary, as the Miyaura-borylation gave only trace
amounts of precursor <bold>3</bold>, when the reaction was performed directly with aldehyde
<bold>7a</bold> (Scheme 3). With acetal 9, the borylation<sup><xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> proceeded in 48% yield, followed by hydrolysis<sup><xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> to the pinacol precursor <bold>3</bold> in
91%. With an open-chain diethyl acetal, instead of cyclic ethylene acetal, the hydrolysis of
the diethyl acetal required only very mild conditions using catalytic iodine in acetone.
Thus, the diethyl acetal <bold>9</bold> ensured the successful Miyaura-borylation and
allowed the facile release of the aldehyde functionality, while leaving the boronic ester
intact. Accordingly, precursor <bold>3</bold> for the radiosynthesis was synthesized from
1,2diiodobenzene in four steps in an overall yield of %.</p><p id="P8">The racemic 3-benzazepine building block (<italic toggle="yes">rac</italic>)-<bold>5</bold> was
obtained from commercially available 3-benzazepine <bold>11</bold> by cleavage of the benzyl
ether via catalytic hydrogenation in 91% yield (Scheme 3). Chiral resolution of
3-benzazepine (<italic toggle="yes">rac</italic>)-<bold>11</bold> or
(<italic toggle="yes">rac</italic>)-<bold>5</bold> to obtain enantiomerically pure 3-benzazepines
(<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-<bold>5</bold> and (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-5 by chiral HPLC was not
successful, using both normal and reversed stationary phases and various eluent
combinations. Based on previous experience with this class of compounds, chiral resolution
was generally possible for tertiary amines bearing a bulky lipophilic substituent.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Therefore, 3-benzazepine <bold>11</bold> was
reductively <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-alkylated with benzaldehyde and NaBH(OAc)<sub>3</sub> to give
the tertiary amine (<italic toggle="yes">rac</italic>)-<bold>12</bold> in 99% yield. It is worthwhile
mentioning that the benzyl group was selected to enable simultaneous cleavage of both, the

and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) were acquired as technical grade. Anhydrous solvents
needed for conventional organic synthesis were obtained by drying over molecular sieve (4

nitrogen atmosphere using flamedried glassware and standard syringe/septa methods. Reactions
were magnetically stirred and further monitored by TLC performed on Merck TLC glass sheets
(silica gel 60 F<sub>254</sub>). TLC Spots were visualized with UV light
(<italic toggle="yes">&#x003bb;</italic> = 254 nm). Chromatographic purification of products was

are reported in Hz. Multiplicities in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra are generally given as
either s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublets; t, triplet; dt, doublet of triplets;
m, multiplet; or bs, broad singlet. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was conducted
on a ThermoFisher Scientific Exactive<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Plus Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer,
using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in the positive ionization mode; the
resulting data is reported in <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic>. Melting points were
determined with a Mel-Temp<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> capillary melting point apparatus. The

radioisotope dose calibrator. Reaction progress in radiochemistry was monitored with Eckert
&#x00026; Ziegler AR-2000 radio-TLC imaging scanner, operated with the WinScan software (3.14).
Purification of the radiotracers was performed on a semipreparative HPLC with a Merck
Hitachi LaChrome L-7100 pump system, a Shimadzu SPD-10AV UV-vis detector and a Carroll &#x00026;
Ramsey Associates Model 105-S radiation detector, operated with the PowerChrom software
(2.7.9). The semipreparative column used was a Venusil MP C18 (10 mm &#x000d7; 250 mm, 5

0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)), a flow rate of 5 mL/min for 15 min and UV detection at 254

analytical HPLC, using a LabAlliance Series III pump system, Waters 2487 Dual &#x003bb;
Absorbance Detector UV-vis detector, Carroll &#x00026; Ramsey Associates Model 105-S radiation

mL/min for 25 min (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub>R</sub> = 15.9 min) and UV detection at 254 nm.
The molar activity of radiotracers was determined by comparing the UV intensity of a sample
of the formulated product of known activity, against a calibration curve of the
corresponding cold reference of known concentration. The calibration curve was determined
from injecting a sample of 80 &#x003bc;L of OF-NB1 solutions in HPLC eluent in six
