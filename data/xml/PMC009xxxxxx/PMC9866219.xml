Introduction</title><p>Crystalline porous materials containing light elements connected reversibly in two to three dimensions through covalent bonds is a developing category of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) [<xref rid="B1-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Due to unique properties and broad applications, interest in the nanoporous materials field has increased. Scientists used different methods to synthesize porous materials. Before the introduction of the reticular chemistry concept, it was difficult for scientists to prepare discrete porous size organic polymer networks [<xref rid="B2-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) were the first porous materials that were synthesized using the reticular chemistry concept. MOFs were synthesized using polytopic linkers which form a network of polyatomic inorganic metal-containing clusters [<xref rid="B3-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The first successful porous organic frameworks are COFs, which are covalent in nature and are capable of integrating organic blocks with precision into a systematic structure [<xref rid="B4-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. COFs can be prepared by applying the dynamic covalent chemistry concept to stitch organic building blocks together [<xref rid="B5-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. COF crystallization through error correction and self-heating in which structural disorders are repaired dynamically is facilitated by reversible thermodynamic bond formation [<xref rid="B7-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. COFs have high thermal stabilities, possessing low mass densities with permanent porosity as they are constructed from light-weight elements connected together through strong covalent bonds [<xref rid="B8-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Different aspects of COFs have been investigated, reviewed, and reported by a number of researchers [<xref rid="B9-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. COFs are further classified into two categories depending on their building block dimensions:</p><p>Two-dimensional (2D) COFs;</p><p>Three-dimensional (3D) COFs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-polymers-15-00267"><title>2.

New Energy Sources</title><p>Using different energy resources, COFs can be synthesized. Stable crystalline products which are thermodynamically stable can be synthesized using thermal energy [<xref rid="B14-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. High energy input and a long time is required for such reactions. Alternative energy resources, such as mechanical agitation, light irradiation, ultrasound, electron beams, and a microwave, can be employed to improve the crystallites nucleation and synthesis of COFs [<xref rid="B1-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot2-polymers-15-00267"><title>2.1.2. Microwave-assisted Solvothermal Synthesis</title><p>Different functional materials like MOFs [<xref rid="B15-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], metal oxides [<xref rid="B16-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], zeolites, [<xref rid="B15-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and organic molecules [<xref rid="B17-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have been synthesized using microwave-assisted reactions. This type of synthesis achieved interest as it provides good reaction attributes, such as low energy consumption, accelerated reaction rates, and higher yields. The first microwave-assisted synthesis was reported by Cooper&#x02019;s group in 2009 [<xref rid="B14-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. COF-5 (Boronate ester-linked COF) assembled rapidly through 2,3,6,7,1,11-hexahydroxytriphenlene and 1,4-benzenediboronic acid condensation at 100 &#x000b0;C under microwave irradiation in 20 min. This approach is 200-fold quicker than traditional solvothermal approach [<xref rid="B4-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. COF-5 possesses a 2019 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> Brunauer&#x02013;Emmett&#x02013;Teller (BET) surface area greater than the solvothermal synthesized surface area, which is 1590 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Similarly, Boronate ester-linked COF (BTD-COF), which is mesoporous, was synthesized by Bein&#x02019;s group through microwave-assisted synthesis. Under two sequential heatings for 40 min, a BTD-COF with a 1000 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BET surface area was synthesized, which is highly crystalline [<xref rid="B18-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot3-polymers-15-00267"><title>2.1.3. Sonochemical Synthesis</title><p>Sonochemical synthesis reduces synthesis time by omitting the induction period. It consumes less energy and is less costly. This synthesis increases the crystallization rate, thus producing high pressures (&#x0003e;1000 bar) and temperatures (&#x0003e;5000 bar) [<xref rid="B19-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The first sonochemical synthesis was reported in 2012 by Ahn and co-workers. Under ultrasonication for 1 h, COF-1 and COF-5 (boron-based COFs) were synthesized. COF-5 produced through sonochemical synthesis possess a 2122 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BET surface area and have a higher yield compared to a solvothermal synthesized analog [<xref rid="B20-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot4-polymers-15-00267"><title>2.1.4. Mechanochemical Synthesis (MC)</title><p>A variety of porous materials have been synthesized through MC synthesis; for example, metal oxides [<xref rid="B21-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], porous carbon [<xref rid="B22-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], MOFs, [<xref rid="B23-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and graphene derivatives [<xref rid="B24-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The synthesis of COFs through MC synthesis is still under development. MC synthesis is ecofriendly, simple, and cost-effective. COF synthesis through solvent-free MC synthesis was first developed by Banerjee&#x02019;s group in 2013. This was done at room temperature by manually grinding COF precursors for 40 min in a mortar [<xref rid="B25-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. TpPa-1(MC) and TpPa-2(MC) (COFs) produced via MC synthesis comprised low BET surface area and moderate crystallinity. The COFs showed exceptional behavior in boiling water, 3M NaOH (aq), and 9M HCl (aq) for chemical stability. Another beneficial feature of MC synthesis is the conversion of COFs to 2D nanosheets by spontaneous delamination [<xref rid="B26-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A liquid-assisted grinding (LAG) method was used in 2016 by the same group to increase the rate of synthesis of COFs. In the LAG approach, catalytic liquids were added to aggregate the reactants and improve crystallinity and yield. Using this strategy at room temperature, Tp-Bpy-MC (2,2&#x02032;-bipyridine-based COF) was synthesized by Banerjee and co-workers in 90 min [<xref rid="B27-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot5-polymers-15-00267"><title>2.1.5. Photochemical Synthesis</title><p>For diversified functional materials, the photochemical synthesis approach has evolved as a beneficial approach. At room temperature and under UV irradiation, the synthesis of COF-5 (UV-COF-5) photochemically was developed by Choi, Lim, and co-workers with a 48-fold increased growth rate and 2027 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BET surface area [<xref rid="B28-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot6-polymers-15-00267"><title>2.1.6. Electron Beam Irradiation-induced Synthesis</title><p>For the synthesis of functional materials, high-energy radiation was employed. An example of such a synthesis is imine-based COF (EB-COF-1), which results from condensation between 2,4,6-tris-(4-formylphenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine and TAPB under 1.5 MeV electron beam at room temperature. This took about 160 s [<xref rid="B29-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This methodology ensures the fast synthesis of COFs and led to pathways for the industrial manufacturing of COFs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-polymers-15-00267"><title>2.2. Different Key Components</title><sec id="sec2dot2dot1-polymers-15-00267"><title>2.2.1. Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title><p>Kinetically regulated processes that generate irreversible covalent bonds have traditionally dominated the production of polymeric materials. Using irreversible processes, the crystallization of linked organic polymers is difficult. Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC), conversely, results in the advancement of reversible covalent bonds that can be generated, disrupted, and reformed [<xref rid="B30-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. DCC is thermodynamically controlled and, unlike traditional covalent bond creation, it results in a reversible reaction that is capable of &#x0201c;proofreading&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;error checking&#x0201d; properties producing structures that are thermodynamically stable. COF synthesis through the DCC concept results in a polymer skeleton which is formed concurrently with the crystallization process. Self-healing feedback lowers structural disorders and aids in the creation of an arranged structure [<xref rid="B8-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A highly thermodynamically stable product with a well-defined crystalline structure is produced as a result. In order to maintain thermodynamic control in reversible reactions, involving reaction conditions and reaction media, two main issues must be considered in designing and manufacturing COFs: the structure of the key components and the synthetic method [<xref rid="B30-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot2-polymers-15-00267"><title>2.2.2. Structure of Key Components</title><p>The structure of the key components must fulfill two basic criteria in order to acquire a crystalline and regulated COF [<xref rid="B8-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p>The COF formation reaction must not be irreversible reaction;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p>The shape of key components must be highly conserved in COF.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The key components must have groups that are reactive enough to activate dynamic covalent bond creation, i.e., there should be no non-reversible side reactions, and under thermodynamic conditions, there should only be oligomers in the reaction system, polymers, and monomers that can be exchanged. Building blocks must be conformational and stiff, and the orientation of bond formation should be distinct. To fulfill the first condition for the successful creation of COF, different reversible processes have been investigated. The chemistry of most of the known structures is boron-based. Boronic acids self-condensate with dialcohols to form five- and six-membered boronate and boroxine ester linkages, respectively [<xref rid="B4-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the presence of the catalyst BF<sub>3</sub>OEt<sub>2</sub>, which is a Lewis acid, a reaction between boronic acids and acetonide-protected catechols took place to generate COFs (<xref rid="polymers-15-00267-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B31-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This deprotection approach in situ is a useful way to avoid oxidation and solubility issues with the construction elements, particularly big aromatic dialcohols. Tetraboronic acid condensation with tert-butylsilanetriol is used to create borosilicate linkages, which have been employed to create COFs, similar to boroxine or boronate esters [<xref rid="B32-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Despite their heat resistance property, COFs (boron-based) are vulnerable to strike and can react with airborne water vapors [<xref rid="B33-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Yaghi&#x02019;s team invented new COF connection chemistries [<xref rid="B34-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Under ionothermal conditions, the cyclical trimerization of cyano groups generated covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs) [<xref rid="B35-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. CTFs have excellent chemical, mechanical, and thermal stabilities, as well as a high-level of conjugation; nevertheless, due to the weak reversibility of the trimerization reaction, they often have low crystallinity [<xref rid="B36-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-polymers-15-00267"><title>2.3.

Boron-Containing COFs</title><p>Boron-containing COF (<xref rid="polymers-15-00267-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a) synthesis via boronate anhydride or boronate ester has grabbed researchers&#x02019; interests after Yaghi and co-workers&#x02019; first creation of COF-1 and COF-5 [<xref rid="B4-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Interestingly, the most produced COFs are boron-containing compounds, which could be organized into two groups based on their synthetic techniques. COFs made from the self-condensation of mono building units represents one class of boron-containing COFs. For instance, a 1,4-benzenediboronic acid self-condensation reaction produced 2D COF-1 [<xref rid="B4-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. COFs made through the co-condensation of two or more building components make up another major group of boron-containing COFs [<xref rid="B38-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Boronic acid and diol combine to generate five-membered C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>B rings in a dehydration reaction. In case of 2D COFs, where the 2D neighboring layers are mounted vertically, layered eclipsed structures are frequently generated. Three-dimensional COFs with complex architectures can be created using tetrahedrally structured building elements. The benefit of this co-condensation technique is the wide range of boronic acid and diol combinations that may be used as building blocks to create a variety of COFs with various characteristics and functions. A 2D COF material (HHTP-DPB COF) with a large pore size (4.7 nm) was successfully generated through the co-condensation of monomers [<xref rid="B39-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, this co-condensation technique could be used to adjust the functionality of COF materials. For example, tetra(4-dihydroxyboryl-phenyl)methane 26 and tert-butylsilane triol [t BuSi(OH)<sub>3</sub>] co-condensation produced 3D COF-202 with butyl functional groups via borosilicate formation [<xref rid="B32-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Two hydroxyl groups of one &#x02013;B(OH)<sub>2</sub> react separately with separate triols, unlike the boronic acid dehydration reaction which generates C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>B rings, which are five-membered [<xref rid="B40-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is worth noting that the <sup>1</sup>HNMR spectroscopic examination of digested COF materials can be used to evaluate the proportion of integrated monomer.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3dot2-polymers-15-00267"><title>2.3.2. Triazine-Based COFs (CTFs)</title><p>Thomas and colleagues created a category of COFs, known as covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs) [<xref rid="B40-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Nitrile building blocks at 400 &#x000b0;C in the presence of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> undergoes cyclotrimerization to produce CTFs. The CTF-1 (<xref rid="polymers-15-00267-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b) material, for example, is made by cyclotrimerizing 1,4-dicyanobenzene (DCB) and possesses a 791 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BET surface area and 1.2 nm pore size. The Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) design revealed that CTF-1 has a 2D hexagonal structure like that of COF-1. Surprisingly, a greater ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (10:1) ratio results in an amorphous polymer with a greater surface area (1123 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

Furthermore, hydrogen bonds produced a b/w N atom of COFETTA-TPAL, and the &#x02013;COOH of GOx and MP-11 may aid in enzyme immobilization [<xref rid="B123-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>].</p><p>Protein can completely or partially block the pore, as well as the fact that transport b/w reagents and products is limited; the fabrication of porous COFs is considered to truncate diffused path lengths to overcome these limits. Sun et al. demonstrated that porous COFs (hexagonal and triangular pores) can be used to encapsulate enzymes. The big hexagonal pores were loaded with enzymes, while the triangular pores allowed reagents and products to freely move in and out [<xref rid="B132-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. In the context of activity and chemical resistance to by-products, enzymes that fenced in COFs with double pores surpassed those that fenced in COFs with regular porosity [<xref rid="B133-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Following that, a similar group has published the spatial configuration of enzymes in confined pore contexts and their effects on the degree of freedom of the hosted enzymes and subsequent catalytic activity [<xref rid="B134-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. They created three isoreticular COFs with varying hydrophilicity and studied and determined the relationship between the pores&#x02019; chemical environment, changes in the degree of freedom of the hosted enzymes, and the ultimate catalytic activity of these immobilized enzymes. With the rise in hydrophilicity of COFs, it was shown that lysozyme became more confined and had less activity. The immobilized enzyme&#x02019;s reactivity changes in response to various host&#x02013;guest interactions. This research enabled us to predict the function of biocomposites that are unknown. Interestingly, Chen and colleagues recently developed a vicarious drafting technique to create hollow COF capsules for encapsulating the enzymes and other biological molecules [<xref rid="B135-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Enzyme@MOF was first created in digestible MOFs by in situ encapsulation to shield enzymes and aid as a template for the development of the enzyme @MOF@COF core&#x02013;shell structure. After that, the MOF core was scraped away, allowing enzymes to be released into the hollow COF capsule. This method was discovered to work with a variety of MOF templates, such as ZIF-90, ZIF-8, and ZPF-2, and COF capsules, such as COF-42-B and COF-43-B). This unique technique created a comfortable atmosphere for enzyme molecules to eject, increased conformational freedom of enzymes, increased mass transfer and safety from the outer atmosphere, and ultimately increased the activity of enzyme. To enhance bioreactor performance, the COF shell could be adjusted finely. Furthermore, many enzymes could have been encased and trickled synergistically in COF capsules [<xref rid="B123-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4dot9-polymers-15-00267"><title>4.4.9. Biocatalysis</title><p>In recent years, biocatalysts have received a lot of interest as a sustainable and eco-friendly approach for the large-scale manufacturing of chemicals. However, their practical execution is frequently hindered by their worse ability to be recycled and long working stability [<xref rid="B136-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Porous materials, such as zeolites, mesoporous silica, celite, COF, and MOF, are being studied as molecular flasks for storing enzymes. Sun et al. recently published a report in which they used 2D COF (imine-based) as a biomolecular flask for the immobilization of enzymes [<xref rid="B125-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. As a first precursor material, the authors used COF-OMe, which is made from 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)-benzene and dimethoxy terephthaldehyde condensation. COF&#x02013;mesoporous OMe&#x02019;s channel, which is 1D, with a pore size of 3.3 nm, can successfully encapsulate amano lipase PS with the same small length while maintaining its activity. The enzyme COF biocomposite (COF&#x02013;OMe&#x02013;PS) surpasses enzymes that are free and other biocomposites that are made from different porous materials, such as metalorganic framework and mesoporous silica, in catalytic activities, according to the authors. They also showed that the function of such host-immobilized enzymes may be regulated by altering the inner pore wall functions of host COFs while preserving the very same reticular chemistry [<xref rid="B133-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. The same group has described an exciting technique for using porous 2D COF as a host material for immobilizing enzymes. It improves the activity of enzymes, robustness, and ability of the catalyst to be recycled. COF&#x02013;ETTA&#x02013;EDDA, a star-shaped 2D COF with dual-pores created by the scientists, contains huge hexagonal mesopores at the center with 3.98 nm diameter and are walled by triangular micropores. When compared to the single-pore analogue, COF&#x02013;PY&#x02013;EDDA, the dual-pore 2D COFs have much a higher enzymatic activity and recycling capability (<xref rid="polymers-15-00267-f011" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>) in the transesterification reaction, which is catalyzed by enzymes [<xref rid="B136-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. The improved efficiency of porous 2D COF is thought to be due to byproduct-active diffusion via tiny pores, which prevents the blockage of active sites of the enzyme, while big pores are involved in the conservation of enzymes after catalytic cycles. The adsorption efficiency of guest molecules may be greatly influenced by modifying the pore wall of the host COF. Lohse et al. recently synthesized B-ketoenamine-based 2D COFs. Samui et al. investigated a 2D COF which is an amine-based COF for the preservation of a-amylase, which is an industrially important enzyme [<xref rid="B126-polymers-15-00267" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4dot10-polymers-15-00267"><title>4.4.10.

Conclusions and Future Prospects </title><p>COFs have a porous framework and are more versatile than any other porous materials. The development of COFs is still in its early stages. The unique physical and chemical properties make them more reliable to use, especially regarding high chemical and thermal stabilities. Strong covalent bonding is present between the linkers; hence, COFs can be modified easily. Organic linkers such as FGs undergo polymerization to form COFs. COF-derived materials can be used in different applications, including environmental remediation and catalysis.</p><p>The unique characteristics of COFs are their extremely porous nature and stability. These characteristics make COFs more powerful tools for environmental remediations. Due to their porous nature, the adsorption, filtration, and separation of different components through COFs is made possible. The large porous size allows bulky organic molecules to pass through them. COFs do not contain metal atoms/ions in them, which is another powerful feature of COFs to be used as environmental remediators. COFs are ecofriendly in many ways. For the removal of contaminants in water, COFs are used for degradation. With the help of luminescent COFs, even low concentrations of contaminants can be detected.</p><p>The use of COFs as biomaterials is still in its early stages, it is essential to determine specific areas where COFs could be useful. COFs, like polymeric biomaterials, can be designed and functionalized in a variety of ways. Medicinal components can be loaded into COFs through built-in and tunable porosity channels. To accomplish functional roles, the drug entrapment amount and release rate of COFs can be modified within a specific range by systematically adjusting pore size and polarity. COFs can be employed to enhance the photothermal effect of nanomaterials or as transporters for photothermal agents in photothermal therapy. In contrast to a closed porous structure, which impedes heat transfer, COFs can rapidly transport temperature. COFs possess high load capacity because of their systematic pore structure and high specific surface area. COFs are employed to transport drugs to the target in drug chemotherapy. COFs with a wide surface area and porosity, high electrical conductivity, and novel interactions with bioactive compounds could diagnose (biosensing and bioimaging) cancer.</p><p>COFs can be used for metal catalytic applications (heterogeneous catalysis) as they do not contain metal atoms/ions in them. COFs have high thermal and chemical stabilities with adjustable active sites. These properties make COFs ideal porous catalysts. COFs such as COFs with reactive metals, COFs with molecular catalysts, COFs with reactive linkages, and COFs with reactive pendant groups can be made either in post-synthetic, in situ or bottom-up methods. COFs have been used for various catalytic processes like photocatalysis, chemical catalysis, and electrocatalysis for almost a decade. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional COF- based catalysts with unique structural and chemical features have been designed to catalyze different reactions, such as redox reactions, organic coupling reactions, degradation, and addition reactions. COFs showed better catalytic activities than other catalysts. COF base photocatalysts have been designed with photoactive linkages by installing photoactive metals in the porous confinement of COF. The photocatalytic COFs are used for organic redox reactions, CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, water splitting, radical formation, and organic transformation reactions. COF-based catalysts possess better structural activity relationship understanding, good confinement effect, size sieving and mass transfer, and better access of substrate concentration and catalytic site due to their high surface area. With COF-based catalysts, catalytic reactions can proceed through different mediums. Catalytic sites can be easily installed, and guest species can be incorporated easily due to manageable pore space.</p><p>Despite all the efforts made for the development of COFs, the development is still in its early stages. There is still more to be developed; for example, 3D COFs in comparison to 2D variants are less explored. The development of 3D COFs is extensively needed for photocatalytic and electrocatalytic applications.</p><p>The following challenges must be addressed: Facile methods should be explored for COF synthesis. The assembly of COF-based functional materials should be investigated, and a relationship should be established between structure and performance. Cost effective linkers should be selected so that further advancement of COFs can be done. COFs should be assessed against environment hazards. Recycling and reuse of COF-based materials should be addressed for more advancements in COFs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are indebted to the Deanship of Scientific Research at Jouf University, Saudi Arabia, for their extraordinary support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
